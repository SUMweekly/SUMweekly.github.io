<p>Fresh from releasing the Jazz-influenced musical odyssey ‘Divine Ascension’, Muva of Earth<strong> </strong>creates soulful, hypnotic music that resonates with the depths of your mind. Always focused on growing her community, Muva is also known for creating <a href="https://www.instagram.com/babylonchantdown/">Babylon Chant Down</a>, a safe space for the diaspora which captured the energy and emotions of last summer, whilst also promoting often-ignored creative voices…</p>

<p><strong>How did you get into music?</strong></p>



<p>I’ve always loved music from an early age, I was always dancing, singing, flowing on stage, just manifesting it you know? My mum enjoys gospel music but my family doesn’t really have a passion for it, so I’ve always had to fight and push myself to get into it.</p>



<p>The first step was singing lessons, they really helped me gain control of my voice, learn techniques and ways to maintain it. I then started going to music school, I grew up in London but then moved to Kent when my mum remarried, which was obviously a mad change.</p>



<p>There was a lot of space out there, I was grateful for the open areas and opportunity to experience different things. I think travelling from Kent to East London for music helped me grow as a person, I could just flow from two very different situations.</p>

<p><strong>Where does your name come from?</strong></p>



<p>The name ‘muva of Earth’ comes from my nickname ‘Mother’ in college, I was known for having colourful clothing and it just stuck. I’m definitely a spiritual person and am trying to grow my practice every day, to really grow and develop you have to incorporate spirituality into your every day. I feel like my music reflects that, it mirrors what’s going on in my heart and my emotions.</p>

<p><strong>How do you make music?</strong></p>



<p>I have to be in the right mindset to make a song. Obviously you can make music from a place of pain, but I have blockages if I’m not feeling comfortable and calm. Before I made ‘Divine Ascension’ I was homeless for some time, I was struggling to get into the studio and had to move back to Kent. When I finally found my sanctuary I made Divine Ascension, <em>‘My soul will always flow, beyond this dimension’, </em>it’s about being resilient and manifesting good things to come.</p>

<p><strong>Tell us about your experiences last year and how that resulted in Babylon Chant Down?</strong></p>



<p>Last year was really traumatic for the whole African Diaspora. Racism has always been presented to us in images in black and white, as if it was long time ago. British institutions try and convince us that we’re better now, that racism is a relic from a bygone era&#8230; I remember just lying in my bed and just deeping that there are actually people out there who will hate me because of the colour of my skin.</p>



<p>I went to the protests with the hope of being with the collective and having my voice heard, but to be honest I didn’t feel that comfortable. Protests obviously have importance but it wasn’t the right method for me, I felt that people weren’t listening to each other, and that all this emotion was going to waste.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>Obviously I’m a musician so me and a friend had the idea to have a music-facing gathering, create a safer space where people could speak and really be heard, and that’s how <a href="https://www.instagram.com/babylonchantdown/">Babylon Chant Down</a> came about. There’s many different forms of protest and different methods, we were just trying to find our own.</p>
