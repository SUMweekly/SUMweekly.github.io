<p>Nachael Catnott is a Black British-Caribbean Artist and Experimental Filmmaker living in South London. Nachael focuses on documenting historic and modern relationships between people and places, whilst conceptually evaluating the current and evolving social-political landscape.</p>



<p>“I have a passion for producing dynamic and thought-provoking content that engages with diverse audiences. My practice is intent on addressing issues such as race, class, heritage and gender through a multitude of mediums namely, film, photography, performance and sculpture.”</p>



<p>We sat down with Nachael for an extended interview, exploring her work, accessibility and how a yam became a re-ocurring symbol in her work…</p>



<p><strong>Talk to me a bit about South London and your work</strong></p>



<p>I think in general a lot of my work is interested in giving a voice to underrepresented people and trying to find out stories or histories or identities that people might not have that much information about. That started during my BA where I started to look more into my own personal identity. I started using yam as a reference and a symbol of the black experience and the presence of multiculturalism in Britain.</p>



<p>Ultimately for me, coming from South London, that’s kind of my foundation; that’s where I had the experience of growing up with so many different people from different walks of life&#8230; predominantly in an area like Lewisham, you do have such a class spectrum as well and just so many different nationalities; I think that’s why it’s at the heart of a lot of what I do.</p>



<p>And I think it’s just a case of being from a place like south London, I feel like for me I’ve always been trying to sort of show what we can do.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="573" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Few-Stains-of-Colour-1-2-1024x573.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4963" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Few-Stains-of-Colour-1-2-1024x573.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Few-Stains-of-Colour-1-2-768x430.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Few-Stains-of-Colour-1-2-1536x860.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Few-Stains-of-Colour-1-2-1320x739.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>How do you decide what goes into a piece?</strong></p>



<p>I guess it’s a feeling. The red puffer jacket series came about through my interest in fashion and the adaptation and appropriation of fashion items. Fast fashion especially has taken a lot from streetwear and what used to be associated with working class people. I just think it’s interesting with the flow of society how a lot of these references are now kind of everyday things. And you’re seeing references to different cultures in high fashion with what I feel like is not the right reference, which is where we lead into the exploitation and the appropriation side of things.</p>



<p>With Daughters of Hannah there’s references to my recent journey into spirituality. We went to that same church school &#8211; everyone thinks it’s really random but that was a journey going there! So there’s a lot of reference there to my personal journey with spirituality, also making references to different religions and how they combine, and using the yam as kind of this anchor.</p>



<p>I’m just interested in a lot of the conversations that I have and I think in the last year I’ve been more interested in trying to create a more positivity led black experience. Naturally lots of the documentaries I’ve worked on tend to have some references to the struggle because I think that’s kind of the start of a lot of people’s stories, especially people of colour, so I wanted to create a more positive outlook on blackness.</p>



<p>A big reference for me is, because I’ve lived and grown up here, being a third generation of migrants. A lot of my references can only come though second hand information, whether it’s those conversations I’m having with my granddad or when I go and visit the Caribbean when get to do so.</p>



<p>Also the internet or books, secondary sources really, so I guess I’m also interested in looking at those connections, whether it’s beach landscapes that I have access to in the UK versus, I guess, the Homeland. There’s a lot of trying to find those pockets of spaces in Britain.</p>



<p><strong>Do you find not having access to those ancestral spaces as a member of the diaspora something limiting or empowering in your work?</strong></p>



<p>I feel like there’s been this shift, especially with the rise in politics around BLM. I think there’s been this embracing, especially within the Caribbean community, of what is the wider diaspora and with African heritage. It feels like there’s more of a community coming together.</p>



<p>No one questions when I make reference to Africa in my work because I’ve always had the knowledge, whether that’s through my parents talking about the struggle, whether it’s slavery, whether it’s ancestry… I’ve always been very interested in my wider ancestry and heritages.</p>



<p>I definitely feel like since using predominantly yam as a medium I’ve been able to lean more into the diaspora and have my work feel like it has a presence within that community if you know what I mean.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Recollection2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4944" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Recollection2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Recollection2-768x432.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Recollection2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Recollection2-1056x594.jpg 1056w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Recollection2-1320x743.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Do you ever feel that the discrimination that comes with being Black can hinder how freely you can express yourself in your work?</strong></p>



<p>That’s interesting because I had an ‘in conversation’ session with an artist called Janette Parris &#8211; she’s a Goldmiths alumni and a renowned artist, and she now lives and practices in the South London area &#8211; and she was speaking about how it’s almost like as soon as you’re a black artist, suddenly your work has to be hyper-political. Like you can’t just paint flowers, it suddenly becomes ‘black artist paints flowers’, and you become this political symbol, your art becomes this political symbol, just because you’re black.</p>



<p>Daniel Kaluuya said the same thing about just wanting to be an actor and I think he got dragged for that because people were like “oh you’re supposed to be this champion, you’re meant to stand for the black kings” and he wasn’t saying he’s not happy to do that…</p>



<p>When you look at so many shows I used to watch when I was younger in the black section of Netflix, and back in the day it would just be a rom-com but now it’s a ‘black’ love story. That’s what’s really interesting: it becomes quite hard to categorise, because obviously in one breath we’re advocating for more inclusivity and black stories but we don’t want to, within that, be marginalised and turned into this one trick pony.</p>



<p>And I think at the moment a lot of my work naturally has reference to race because at the moment I’ve used, or it’s been easier to use, my own identity to investigate what’s going on in the political climate. It just so happens that we’re going through another epidemic or continued epidemic when it comes to racism, so then the work becomes more poignant and it feels more political than it actually probably is. Whereas a lot of the work, especially for me recently, is becoming more like self-discovery.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="577" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Recollection1-1024x577.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4943" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Recollection1-1024x577.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Recollection1-768x433.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Recollection1-1536x865.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Recollection1-1056x594.jpg 1056w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Recollection1-1320x743.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>You still do work in these institutions; have you seen any changes in the institutional landscape when it comes to art schools/the arts and diversity?</strong></p>



<p>It was quite interesting because there were points throughout my education here I could just count the black people or people of colour on my hand in spaces; I call it the Where’s Wally analogy, where you walk into a space and you start counting the black people. It almost starts as a joke but then you start doing it unconsciously and you’re like ‘oh snap, I’m doing that thing again.’ Throughout art school we were in the minority, and I remember having a conversation with someone being like ‘oh well, you know, they don’t apply’ and me thinking that’s not justification anymore&#8230;</p>



<p>Make yourselves known as an institution that is welcoming people – because that’s the problem. People don’t see themselves in those spaces, so they assume that it’s not for them, and that is the whole problem when it comes to representation. I think I’ve had one lecturer of colour that taught me throughout the whole of my university experience, then there was a black female lecturer that I didn’t have because I decided to study abroad that year. That’s literally throughout the whole of my university experience.</p>



<p>It’s not enough anymore for that to be the case. So when it comes to institutions, especially academic institutions, there’s so much work to be done in order to create representation that’s in the curriculum. There’s no reason for there not to be a black British art history curriculum, you know.</p>



<p>We can reel off so many names, and especially in contemporary art, so there’s no need. I think we’re in a stage now where as a community we’re tired of the lip service and we’re tired of the tick box notion, so we can only hope that there will be a change when it comes to, particularly for me, the curriculum… What was quite striking when I was doing my Battle of Lewisham job, when I was researching a lot for these different documentaries (whether it was about knife crime or policing), was how many people don’t know about our history when we spent countless years learning about Henry the 8<sup>th</sup>.</p>



<p>Henry the 8<sup>th</sup> isn’t going anywhere. There’s a whole, you know, Hampton Court that you can go visit. For me I did grow up knowing these stories but even then, only in a very word of mouth sort of way from my parents, maybe in passing. But the Battle of Lewisham more so because it directly affected my family. But yeah to have none of that referenced in the curriculum, even the Battle of Lewisham, is ridiculous to me.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-Battle-of-Lewisham-Still--1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4945" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-Battle-of-Lewisham-Still--1024x683.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-Battle-of-Lewisham-Still--768x512.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-Battle-of-Lewisham-Still--1536x1024.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-Battle-of-Lewisham-Still--1320x880.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>I think at this present moment I’m kind of hitting this wall of questioning who the work’s for, thinking about exactly what you’re saying, how much to give into the subject. There’s the battle of Lewisham film, and my family is very much connected to that story and because of the traumatic nature of it the documentary’s actually a very different documentary than what it could have been, and I completely stripped my family’s direct involvement. And that was for two reasons; it was in one sense to protect my family and, again, like you mentioned, the trauma, but also because it was a bigger story at the time.</p>



<p><strong>You mentioned your family &#8211; your grandparents are of the Windrush generation, and your heritage works a lot into your practice; does it ever get too difficult when you’re getting very personal with it and telling these stories that are hard for not only yourself but for your family to relive?</strong></p>



<p>I’ve had quite a good experience. I’ve spent quite a lot of time speaking to and interviewing my granddad specifically and I think it’s been quite cathartic for him as someone who’s been through a lot of trauma, had a lot of experiences. He’s watched the documentary about knife crime, he’s watched the documentary about the New Cross Fire, and it’s interesting. When we’re doing the sessions and he’s relaying these things to me it can be quite difficult, to hear about the genuine struggle it was to be a black man in 1985. But I do genuinely think it’s important for me to be documenting these things or at least having that record of those conversations.</p>



<p>It was 40 years since the battle of Lewisham so it felt more like a story about the actual happening and the people, not just our separate family story, which would require a lot more sensitivity. I think naturally the closer you are to something the harder it can be, but I think that’s why using this recurring image of the yam allows me to be able to, you know, think about the topic in more of a nuanced and abstract way. Also, using the yam’s quite humorous.</p>



<p><strong>I’m glad we’re back with yam &#8211; when and how did it evolve from this food or everyday object into the symbol you make it in your work?</strong></p>



<p>It’s a weird one because I was studying abroad, during my BA, in Vancouver. I was in western Canada so there wasn’t a language barrier, so going into that space I didn’t expect to have this big culture shock. I didn’t expect to have this big cultural identity awakening. I got there and everyone was calling me African American. And I was like… I’m just confused! I’m here with what I believe is a very think South London accent, or at least a very British accent&#8230; Calling me African American?</p>



<p>And I had a task when I got back from studying abroad, we all had to do a show, and yam drew me in. I just felt… I’m going to put yam in a bag and make a few sculptures out of them because my mum used to have this running joke when we were younger: ‘if you don’t behave yourself I’ll send you back to the Caribbean to plant yam,’ and I just always thought that was quite interesting. And since then I’ve kind of stuck with it as a medium because I’m still not necessarily finished with it. Again, at the moment, at this specific time, I might be at a slight wall with it, and I’m thinking about how I want to refine using the medium.</p>



<p>The yam is very much linked to the experience of black people and them migrating into the landscape. It’s so interesting &#8211; the sculptures are quite tall and a lot of people ask me “where did you buy that material from?” or “what is it?” It was hilarious when I was at Goldmiths because people would ask where did you get it from and I was like across the road… literally across the road.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-Battle-of-Lewisham-Still-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4946" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-Battle-of-Lewisham-Still-1024x683.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-Battle-of-Lewisham-Still-768x512.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-Battle-of-Lewisham-Still-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-Battle-of-Lewisham-Still-1320x880.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>When I was in Reading I started working with a girl who was from Poland and she one day said to me “I’m going to go get traditional polish food from a shop just across the road” and I was like “where?” At this point I’d lived there going on four years so I said oh okay I’ll come with you, very intrigued as to where I was going to find this shop… and it’s right in the centre of town, right between Burger King and Iceland or whatever. And I thought how have I never seen this place before?</p>



<p>When I think about that, that’s how I think maybe people see the yam. It almost just gets etched out because it’s not a cultural norm or necessity for them. So yeah, that’s kind of the story of me working with yam as a material. It’s interesting because I recently just started becoming a figure within the work. Prior it was more sculpture and other subjects that I’m interviewing. When you do performance art sometimes having to direct people, especially in an artistic way where it’s so abstract, it can be difficult. Whereas for me I knew what I was thinking in terms of style and actuality. I’m not behind the camera.</p>



<p><strong>When you insert yourself into your art how do you see yourself? What’s your relation to yourself and the art?</strong></p>



<p>That’s a good question. I guess I see myself as a subject but also kind of like an art medium, because, obviously, it’s performance so the art going on within the performance kind of becomes the artwork if you know what I mean. And a lot of the actual performances are very much to do with my own thought process at the time, they’re very much off the cuff because they’re meant to be live and in the moment.</p>



<p>I don’t want to have to sit and plan these really rigid routines or whatever. I think it’s all about the connection with the space and the audience in the specific time. It’s kind of hard to explain it. That’s a very interesting question because I’ve not thought about it in that way. I guess I found it quite liberating to be able to really, in the full sense, explore visually what I’m thinking. Using myself as a subject I’m able to do that.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p><strong>What was the pandemic like for you as an artist, from a creative perspective as well as personally and career-wise?</strong></p>



<p>I think it’s hit me in two different waves. When the pandemic first hit, I think it was actually an opportunity to be like well the only thing I do have is my art practice. Because before that I was spending a lot of time trying to develop in the television industry, an industry that’s very alien to me not coming from an Oxbridge background, which I didn’t even know was apparently the ticket into television, but it is apparently. I was always feeling like I had to beat down walls in that circle…</p>



<p>I kind of had the opportunity during the lockdown to really focus on the art that I had created previously and think about new ideas. I got lucky to have access to a window exhibition, that was for my Evolved piece, for three months. That was interesting; to be able to look at different ways of presenting work. Prior to that a lot of my work was more digital: this was now more print and sculpture, so that was really interesting.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="684" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Daughters-of-Hannah-2-684x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4938" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Daughters-of-Hannah-2-684x1024.jpg 684w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Daughters-of-Hannah-2-768x1150.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Daughters-of-Hannah-2-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Daughters-of-Hannah-2-1320x1977.jpg 1320w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Daughters-of-Hannah-2.jpg 1368w" sizes="(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px" /></figure>

<p>I guess lockdown one felt quite productive in terms of “right, I have my art practice,” etc. etc. The only problem was, as we kept on waiting and waiting for things to open back up, that’s when it started stagnating for me in terms of what I can actually do moving forward. So now I’ve been in this situation where I’m contemplating freelance work and commission work, the realistic nature of being able to form a career in that way. This had been a big dent… I think a lot of us were just starting to get into our stride especially after university.</p>



<p>Just trying to find day to day jobs has been my focus rather than trying to find/run a platform for other people as well as trying to think about what you need to do to survive.</p>



<p>And then we had Black Lives Matter in the cocoon of a pandemic where everyone was inside and the news was just…every single day, you know what I mean. And that was a big hit on me because personally I wasn’t able to go to the protests as we were shielding at the time.</p>



<p>There was this pressure as well, especially as someone who makes work like what we were talking about &#8211; black, political art &#8211; so if you’re not in the frontline suddenly there’s all this pressure around what I should be doing or what as a community we should be doing. It was all task forces and letters and all this stuff, so that also had a hold. And I felt like in a way there was an element of me that wanted to put all that energy into artwork, but it was also exhausting and very traumatic.</p>



<p>So I think we’ve been hit with almost two main things: a pandemic in its natural form which shut down everything, and also what is the growing diversity issue and crisis that we have in this country. It’s been very intense to kind of just function. This time has also allowed me to experiment in ways that I wouldn’t have had access to or had the time to do, so that feels quite exciting and now it’s about trying to refine and think about developing the ideas.</p>



<p><strong>George Floyd &#8211; whenever these big racial incidents happen we always see this push for more black art, more exposure… what was your experience after the event?</strong></p>



<p>The funniest thing was, my phone has not stopped ringing. That space of time was the most calls I’ve gotten. Obviously in March, when no one had any work and with the art industry and television industry sort of crashing, people didn’t really have any sort of work &#8211; that was still going on in May/ June time of that year &#8211; so for me when I was getting all these calls, I can only put my finger on the fact that suddenly they want to draw out the diversity.</p>



<p>Personally, I had a very big problem with black out Tuesday, I did not, I do not support it, especially because it came from within these creative industries trying to boycott and have this kind of black, but that doesn’t actually address the issues. I think what’s been happening are these very quick responses, companies pledging a million this a million that, which doesn’t actually hone in on the heart of the issues, which is the lack of representation at the top. I think a lot of people think we want some of these big wig cis-white men to be kicked off their pedestals and to have to sign on at the job centre; that’s not what we’re saying (not that that wouldn’t be a good idea… but that’s not what we’re saying).</p>



<p>We’re just saying we also want to have a seat at the table. Also, I do think it’s been such a difficult one because there’s been so many interesting ways that people have been trying to think about diversity but also they all feel quite tick boxy. I think the struggle has been that when you do have these institutions that have been white washed trying to lead diversity, they’ll never understand.</p>



<p>It’s weird because it definitely feels like “our time” but at the same time I do think that’s damaging. Because we’re going through a period of trauma and then we’re expected to make work or have these ideas and I think when it first hit there were times when I was drawing a complete blank because I was so fixated on what was the change in the story that was unfolding at the time.</p>



<p>I definitely do think a change is coming, but what I’m worried about is the systematic interplays that it’s rooted in. I do feel there’s kind of like puppeteer elements, people who are holding the privilege in a lot of these institutions and who just want to be seen to be diverse so they don’t get dragged on Instagram and Twitter. So yeah it’s interesting… it’s hilarious actually.</p>

<p><strong>Your latest piece was Daughters of Hannah; will you talk about that a bit</strong></p>



<p>Daughters of Hannah came from spirituality, and it’s kind of looking at the story of Hannah in the bible, in the Old Testament, which sees Hannah initially as barren, wanting a child. And predominantly, as traditional stories go, or biblical references and conventional stories, it’s this male figure that she’s granted with.</p>



<p>So I was interested in how initially she was tormented by that fact that she couldn’t have children, specifically because she was a second wife to someone who could, so I was just interested in those unborn initial female offspring, with a lower case <em>f</em>. I kind of wanted the yam to be this personification of those feelings and I was trying to embody the essence of Hannah in a creating a black female -again, lower case <em>f </em>&#8211; reference to that experience I guess.</p>
</div>

<p>It’s filmed in several different locations, to make reference to placing black bodies in rural landscapes, and you see me walking through the landscapes with the yam. It’s very regal, there’re references to soldiers, and also in this very white pure garment which makes reference to Rastafarianism but also to priesthood… so there were a lot of different ideas in the piece. And it was actually interesting: because of time and because of just general life the work became quite different to what is was meant to be.</p>



<p>It was meant to be this kind of five-part film with me walking through all these different landscapes, and we’ve got all those pieces filmed, but due to time we exhibited for the show still photography and the sculptures, which was interesting because it allowed to me to see each section as separate. I also created this garden piece, which I’d always wanted to create.</p>



<p>I merged poetry and sound and had a lot of collaboration. It was a piece in which I was able to collaborate and really think about my personal journey. There’re references to mental health, references to my own spirituality&#8230; The piece is still developing and evolving. I’m currently in the process of trying to find to an editor to work with to edit the film. I’m thinking around a five to seven minute film, maybe a split screen composition. There’re a lot of ideas and like I said it’s still being developed so it’s an ongoing piece. But there was a lot of collaboration and a lot of montage and working with a lot of different people.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have a piece of art or a project that you’re most proud of?</strong></p>



<p>I’m pretty proud of my degree show piece. That was probably one of the first times my ideas came together because it was actually quite a struggle. It’s interesting, I spoke to my lecturer the other day; I’m still quite good friends with her because I guest lecture back at Reading. My lecturer, Christine Ellison, she was quite tough and I chose her on purpose because you can very much coast by thinking you’ve got great ideas and you get to results day and you’re like huh? She really pushed me and was very much like “there’s something missing, there’s something missing.”Tthere was always something missing, it was very intense.</p>



<p>I think because that was the first time I started experimenting with the yam specifically it was nice to see all the ideas come together. It was kind of like a two-part film where I interview both my granddad and my aunt, who’s from Birmingham. They were both talking about their journeys through Windrush, and I merged that with different experiments I was doing with the yam. It was a powerful way for me to really start thinking about the ideas I was interested in. Technically it wasn’t 100% there, but in terms of all the separate elements I think I’m still trying to work on refining those.</p>



<p>There’s a contrast between that piece, or a connection between that piece, and Daughters of Hannah, and that’s something I find quite interesting as well.</p>

<p><strong>What’s your advice for young artists?</strong></p>



<p>I spent so many years doing a lot of joint things: my degree was art and philosophy, when I was at Goldsmiths I was doing documentary film but I was really trying to keep that foot in the art world, and even now with television because there’re are many different routes you kind of start off trying to do as much of everything as you can and you get yourself at a point where you’re just like… AAAH.</p>



<p>So I think it’s important, and I’ve actually never said this, to just go towards where your passion takes you and try lead that into something you can specialise in. Just be mindful of juggling too many plates because I think they will come crashing down.</p>



<p>A friend of mine also mentioned something to me recently about saying no. As someone who doesn’t come from a space where daddy’s going to give me a job or daddy’s friend’s going to give me a job, I came from this space where you had to say yes to everything, to every opportunity. And then you get to a point where halfway through said opportunity you’re like I don’t know if this is for me but you’re not really from a privileged position where you can say no.</p>



<p>So that’s the other thing, get to a space where if someone might offer you an opportunity to do something but that’s not in your actual plan for yourself or what you want to do, you say no. And I definitely think there’s sometimes more power in saying no, especially if it’s for the sake of the direction in which you want to go.</p>
