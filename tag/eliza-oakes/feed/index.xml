<p>Eliza Oakes is a vocalist, musician and arranger who was born and raised in SE London. After spending years perfecting her skills as a live performer, Eliza has now set out as a recording artist. Coming from her new genre-jumping EP&nbsp; ‘<strong>An Intuition’ </strong>Eliza has just released the stunning visuals for the single ‘<strong>Til They’re Gone</strong>’.</p>

<p><strong>Through hearing clips on instagram a couple years ago I first thought you were very much a jazz vocalist. Your recent music is quite a deviation from these jazz roots, how did that change happen?</strong></p>



<p>So I studied jazz at Guildhall for 4 years, but I never went with the aim to come out at the other end a strictly jazz musician. Don’t get me wrong I love it, but the main aim was to learn how to improvise as a vocalist.</p>



<p>&nbsp;I grew up in a church environment and had always sung with choirs, after completing classical singing grades in school, it got to the point in sixth form where I had to choose musically where to go next.&nbsp; Improvisation is now a solid way in which I express musically!&nbsp;</p>



<p>The motivation behind it was The music industry is designed to box you in a specific genre is seems, I try and stay away from all that and just express what feels right.&nbsp; The first single off the EP ‘Let It Be Known’ definitely feels like a pop record I’d say, but you can hear some of alternative influences creeping in for sure!</p>

<p><strong>There’s even quite a big genre-jump between that single and your new release <em>Til They&#8217;re Gone&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>Definitely, and I had a few worries when writing the EP whether it would feel like a cohesive project, each song on the EP feels like it’s in a separate room!&nbsp; But I’m influenced by many different styles and genres so it feels right!&nbsp; It’s a brief introduction into the ways in which I communicate vocally and musically, so was important to give the listeners a range to sit with.</p>

<p><strong>You’re very much a trained musician, and obviously have skills beyond just your voice, what was creating the EP like?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Well funnily enough it was all kind of done from my bedroom. I knew I Creating this EP was such a new experience for me because I was used to predominately performing music live rather than recording it which takes a different kind of skill.</p>



<p> Faced with the lockdown, I ended up having to record a lot of the parts remotely with the help of my band and wonderful string section that you hear!  It of course wasn’t the same as all being in the same room, but it encapsulates the time and space in which it was born.  </p>



<p>Written, arranged and produced by myself, two of the tracks were also co-produced by long time collaborator and close friend Lorenz Okello.  It’s so important to work with people that you trust and he was the biggest blessing when it came to recording!</p>
</div>
</div>



<p><strong>As you’ve said, gigs and live performances are your forte, do you think that was born from the church?</strong></p>



<p>Because it was my first musical environment, I’d say partly so yes!&nbsp; Even though my relationship with church has changed, I’m heavily inspired and still listen to a lot of gospel music, particularly as a vocalist.&nbsp; I’m also part of a gospel/soul choir called The Mike King Collective- it’s being surrounded by multiple harmonising voices which has had the biggest impact on my voice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also grew up on a lot of musical theatre and so performing live has just always felt really natural to me- even though it can still be nerve-wracking!  When singing live, I never sing a song the same again, it’s so freeing, and something that’s not quite able to be replicated when recording.</p>



<p><strong>Lets talk about the video&#8230;what was the experience like when filming it, and how did you manage to find such an amazing location?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The process of planning, writing and filming a music video I’d never experienced anything like that before, it was immensely overwhelming and stressful leading up to it, especially as an independent artist with no management or label helping me.&nbsp; Balancing the logistics along with my actual performance was indeed a lot to handle but on the day it went pretty smoothly!</p>



<p>The church that it was filmed in is called All Saints Church in New Cross, where I grew up, the wonderful Vicar Grant I’ve gotten to know over the last year, he’s also a great musician and let me use the space to practice and rehearse.&nbsp; He kindly let us use the space for the whole day to capture the shoot!&nbsp; An amazing opportunity indeed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0011resized-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4741" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0011resized-1024x683.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0011resized-768x512.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0011resized-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0011resized-1320x880.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>&nbsp;I asked Elsa Hackett, (also known as ELSAS) to co-direct the video with me.&nbsp; Not only is she a really close friend of mine but one of my favourite artists and musicians who directed her own music video last year!&nbsp; It was a perfect collaboration, and refreshing to have someone interpret the song alongside me.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>The video follows a lead up to a final performance, along the way we’re introducing different visuals, specifically close up shots of hands, and the way they can be held.&nbsp; The concept of the song itself is a personal one but we wanted to capture the feeling of unconditional love, and the fears alongside it in a universal context.&nbsp; There are so many ways two people can hold hands, not to mention the emotions that can also be captured within the gesture whether it be anger, loneliness or love.&nbsp; </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="715" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-2021-11-04-at-10.49.44-copyresized-1024x715.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4752" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-2021-11-04-at-10.49.44-copyresized-1024x715.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-2021-11-04-at-10.49.44-copyresized-768x536.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-2021-11-04-at-10.49.44-copyresized-1536x1072.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-2021-11-04-at-10.49.44-copyresized-1320x921.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It was amazing to work with choreographer Tali Foxworthy-Bowers to portray the songs narrative in the movement of the video, with the ensemble section in the dream-like, spinning state as well as the hand motions.&nbsp; It is all piecing together my imagination to bring forth the simplicity of the final shot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The wonderful cast was made up of a mixture of people i’d grown up with/old friends/new friends and people i’d met on the day, and it really added to the feelings of love that I’m exploring in the song.&nbsp; I wanna give another huge shout out to every person who contributed to this video, wouldn’t have been possible with your support and efforts. &nbsp;</p>
