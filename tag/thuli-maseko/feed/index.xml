<p>Beloved Bahamian-American actor and activist Sidney Poitier passed away on 6 January. He will be remembered as the first black movie star, an accomplished director, social activist, and an icon of cinema. Born in 1927 and growing up in the Bahamas, Poitier would begin acting in his twenties at the Harlem based Community Negro Theatre. It was around fifteen years later that he would become the first black man to win the Oscar for best actor (Lilies of the Field, 1963) and cement his legacy as a true pioneer in Hollywood history.</p>



<p>Outside of his acting career he was a dedicated civil rights and independence activist. Serving as Bahamian ambassador to Japan and UNESCO, and being a vocal advocate for human rights, he used his status to serve his community, with Martin Luther King jr. saying of him; “he is a man of great depth, a man of great social concern, a man who is dedicated to human rights and freedom.” </p>



<p>While many of the characters he played were often criticised as representing “too good to be true” idealisations of the palatable black man, his roles in the likes of In the Heat of the Night and Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner saw him in parts with more depth and gravitas than had previously been given to black actors. Seeing him slap a white man and not die by the end of the film was a powerful thing for many black people to see in a big Hollywood movie. It’s true that much of what we saw of Poitier was a quiet caricature of the ideal black American, an image put upon him by the industry limitations of tokenism and stereotyping, but he had agency,&nbsp;was smart, and expanded black representation in cinema significantly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Before Sidney, African American actors had to take supporting roles in major studio films that were easy to cut out in certain parts of the country. But you couldn&#8217;t cut Sidney Poitier out of a Sidney Poitier picture”&#8230; “He was the reason a movie got made: the first solo above-the-title African American movie star” (Denzel Washington).</p>

<p>Founded by Nigerian-American designer Niyi Okuboyejo, Post-Imperial is a fusion of bright modernity and traditional techniques. “The Post-Imperial aesthetic is a colorful and vibrant ode to new forms of fashion. It carries a strong sense of optimism for the future,” combining traditional African artisanship with contemporary diasporic existence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their latest collection, <a href="https://post-imperial.com/blogs/mythology-new/that-time-i-wanted-to-be-seen">That Time I Wanted to be Seen</a>, is inspired by the shared internal desire to be seen in one way or another at some point in our lives. It takes inspiration from a variety of African cultures and traditions, from West-African percussion instruments to traditional Massai jewelry, as well as aspects of American identity, like the Greater Refuge Temple, “which stands as a religious pillar in the Harlem community.” </p>



<p>Okuboyejo draws greatly on his Nigerian roots. Using traditional African techniques and textiles, the clothes are crafted by African artisans and many fabrics are dyed using Adire, a traditional Yoruba resist dye technique developed in south-western Nigeria. Central to the label, also, is the tradition of mythology, collective stories that are shared among and contributed to by our community. </p>



<p>Through putting community and collective storytelling at the center of the brand, Post-Imperial moves beyond having a single narrative at the center of creation, instead embodying mythology. “[Narrative] is ego-centric. It’s you wanting to grab some sort of power, you wanting to tell the story. [Mythology] is more of a community… Everyone has participated in this story, so it becomes a story that is embodied in them.” Post-Imperial’s approach represents a decentering of the individual in a traditionally individualistic artform. </p>



<p>The label is unlike others in the mainstream with its unique and humanising approach to design. It puts collaboration at the forefront of the creative process, and in so doing, works the complexities and nuances of dismantling power structures into Post-Imperial creations. There’s also an optimistic, future-facing ethos that features in much of African and diasporic creation.</p>



<p>“Post-Imperial is the embodiment of collaborative storytelling. We are all mythmakers. Let’s make myths together.”</p>

<p>While Bell Hooks has always been a giant in revolutionary thought, her recent passing has heighted discussion of her work and the impact she has had on individuals, movements, and progressive thinking. Part of her contribution we should be most grateful for is what she taught us about love.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>hooks is often and rightly lauded as a radical. One of her most radical and revolutionary positions was her view on the socially and politically transformative power of love. It’s through love that we can begin to disconnect ourselves from materialism and systems of domination.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From romantic love to self-love, hooks was fearless and prolific in her advocacy for the concept. She saw what self-hatred and low self-esteem could do to people and, subsequently, whole movements; how through a lack of love fights against oppressive systems could end up feeding into and sustaining others; how when we fail to see the subjecthood of others we are liable to only be moved to action when our own self-interests are threatened.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="819" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/belhooksbase3b-1-819x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5091" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/belhooksbase3b-1-819x1024.jpg 819w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/belhooksbase3b-1-768x961.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/belhooksbase3b-1.jpg 901w" sizes="(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px" /></figure>
</div>

<p></p>



<p>We need what hooks called “a love ethic”, a shared commitment to the welfare of ourselves and others, to ground our struggles against structures of domination; “&#8230; it is in choosing love, and beginning with love as the ethical foundation for politics, that we are best positioned to transform society in ways that enhance the collective good.”</p>



<p>The definition of love hooks embraces sees love as “the will to extend one’s self for the purpose of nurturing one’s own or another’s spiritual growth” (M. Scott Peck). This, for hooks, got closer to the essence of love, and was a good place to start as a working universal definition upon which the foundations of our journeys to love could begin. To “extend” indicates action; understanding love as a verb was central to what hooks teaches us about loving.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="703" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/belhooksbase2-1024x703.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5076" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/belhooksbase2-1024x703.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/belhooksbase2-768x527.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/belhooksbase2-1536x1054.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/belhooksbase2-1320x906.jpg 1320w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/belhooksbase2.jpg 1728w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>One needs to make a commitment to actively do the work on their inner self: reflecting on and honestly assessing one’s internalised supremacist thinking, recognising and working through one’s pain, learning to view oneself objectively and not through the gaze of materialism, classism or sexist ideals. We also make a commitment to the ones we choose to love.</p>



<p>Whether it be the love we extend to ourselves, romantic partners, or our communities, “to truly love we must learn to mix various ingredients &#8211; care, affection, recognition, respect, commitment, and trust, as well as honest and open communication.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="669" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/belhooksbase-1024x669.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5082" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/belhooksbase-1024x669.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/belhooksbase-768x502.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/belhooksbase-1536x1004.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/belhooksbase-2048x1338.jpg 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/belhooksbase-1320x863.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>To love is to act counter to a culture that centres on individualism, materialism, and imperialism. It is to prioritise the authentic over the transactional, community over isolationism. “The moment we choose to love, we begin to move against domination, against oppression. The moment we choose to love we begin to move towards freedom, to act in ways that liberate ourselves and others. That action is the testimony of love as the practice of freedom.” We should honour bell hooks by considering love thoughtfully and comprehensively in progressive discourse, recognising its spiritual as well as revolutionary value. And we should honour ourselves and our communities by choosing it.</p>
