<p> Dustin Lee is a street photographer currently based in Seoul, South Korea. He takes atmospheric shots of the life he encounters throughout the city, constructing a colourful, dream-like perspective of the scenes that unfold around him. His shots inspire wanderlust, showcasing the excitement that comes from exploration of the city, where one gains brief insights into the characters that navigate through it, as they interact with and become a part of their environment.</p>



<p>Dustin has recently published a book entitled <a href="https://www.jgfotograph.com/book/colorinkorea">Color In Korea</a>, containing a series of images taken over his past 6 years living there. Below is an interview from this new book:</p>



<p>Q: What kind of camera do you use?</p>



<p>I use Leica M3 and M4 with both 35mm and 50mm lenses. 135 format is way to go for me because it is very versatile and quick to use.</p>



<p>Q: How often do you shoot?</p>



<p>Well, I always have my camera with me where ever I go. I shoot pretty often and it&#8217;s just part of my daily life routine I should say. But if I do take my time to shoot, I usually photograph at least once every weekend. I try to get one roll per week.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="689" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ds1-1024x689.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2878" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ds1-1024x689.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ds1-768x516.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ds1-1536x1033.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ds1-1320x888.jpg 1320w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ds1.jpg 1969w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Q: What do you think of while taking a photograph?</p>



<p>I just let my thoughts freely float around in my head. I try not to think of anything but everything. If I try not to think of anything, that thought of doing so just get&#8217;s in my way. It interrupts my concentration while I am constantly observing my environment. But there is one clear thought I always keep in mind which is to &#8220;walk slowly&#8221;.</p>



<p>Q: In photography, do you think philosophy is necessary in order to create a great body of work?</p>



<p>First of all, I do not know what great body of work looks like, but I think that philosophy is not about necessity. Straight forward answer would be yes.</p>



<p>I believe that philosophy is always within you rather you like it or not. The moment you had a question or thought about your own existence/meaning in this world, that&#8217;s when your philosophy started. Therefore even if you have not had the means of inputting philosophical thoughts into your work, unconsciously everything that you do is based upon your own philosophy.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="687" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dustin4-1024x687.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2829" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dustin4-1024x687.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dustin4-768x515.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dustin4-1536x1030.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dustin4-1320x885.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Q: Where do you get your inspiration from?</p>



<p>I get my inspiration from my daily life. Just by walking around and observing lights and colors of the world. It also comes from Jazz and writings of great masters of photography such as Saul Leiter and Cartier Bresson. And I get inspired by having a good conversation, passionate dialogue with my friends who are in the film/photo/art world.</p>



<p>Q: Is there a photographer that gives you inspiration?</p>



<p>There are many photographers that I love and look up to. But if I have to choose one, then it gotta be Saul Leiter. His attitude towards the world, his way of seeing, his thoughts and words&#8230;I learn a lot from him. I occasionally re-watch his conversations and documentary time to time. And also look through his photobooks at home with good coffee and jazz.</p>



<p>Q: Between black and white and color photography, which one do you prefer more?</p>



<p>Most of the time, I find myself shooting in color more than black and white films. It is because color photography allows me to express my mood and feelings better.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="688" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dustin3-1024x688.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2828" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dustin3-1024x688.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dustin3-768x516.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dustin3-1536x1031.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dustin3-1320x886.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Q: How long do you shoot?</p>



<p>When I am just strolling around, usually about 3-6 hours. Typically I come back home with half of a roll shot. It&#8217;s really hard for me to press the shutters.</p>



<p>Q: What is photography to you?</p>



<ul id="list"><li>Photography is something that I am doing consistently for a very long time. And even till present moment.</li><li>Photography is a trace of my being, exsistence and pieces of my visual aesthetic memories.</li><li>Photography is me and I am just a part of my own photographs.</li></ul>



<p>Q: What do you want to show the audience with your images?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="686" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ds2-1024x686.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2880" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ds2-1024x686.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ds2-768x515.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ds2-1536x1029.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ds2-1320x884.jpg 1320w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ds2.jpg 1979w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Just photographs of things that I thought it was beautiful and interesting. People have their own free will and I can&#8217;t control what the others might feel. Audience got their own story, expereinces and values. It&#8217;s up to them to either look at my photo for a quick second or to really take it in and connect it to their life. I am just greatful if you even felt anything by looking at my photographs.</p>
