<p>Abnormal Sleepz is part of the meteorical rise of Manchester talent over the last few years, his debut album &#8216;Kaleidoscope&#8217; in 2019 made waves within the scene, and his blend of Hip Hop, Soul and Grime has become more and more recognisable in recent months.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>1.What made you start a career in music? Did you ever consider doing&nbsp;anything else?</strong></p>



<p>I grew up in a musical household, so naturally I always had a bond with music. It was a hobby as well as something I wanted to pursue&nbsp;as a career whether it be as a DJ or an artist,&nbsp;it didn&#8217;t really matter as long as it involved music. When I was younger I was into basketball&nbsp;too so my time was split between the two but I left that behind in college, I grew out of my love for it and wanted&nbsp;to pursue music more.</p>



<p><strong>2.&nbsp;How have you developed as an Artist since releasing your first solo&nbsp;mixtape &#8220;The Meditape&#8221; ?</strong></p>



<p>I&#8217;ve matured more and gained an understanding of my identity. Since Meditape I had started producing again but taking it more seriously which allowed me to truly&nbsp;create my own sound.<br></p>

<p><br>With time comes experience and improvement naturally if you stick to it, so my ability as a rapper, engineer and producer just got better and better with each project. Even with performance, I&#8217;d done more shows which gave me more confidence when connecting with a crowd.</p>

<p><strong>3.Beyond the release of the &#8220;Meditape 3&#8221; mixtape what do you have planned&nbsp;next?<br></strong>As well as coming up on BBC Radio 1&#8217;s Big Weekender there will be more visuals, production and projects. It never stops so the plans to keep going. I want to push more boundaries and showcase the development that took place over the past year so right now it&#8217;s about maintaining the momentum and giving people good music. You will be able to catch me at my show at Blues Kitchen, Manchester &#8211; Thursday, August 5th then back to the studio!</p>



<p><br><strong>4.Outside of your genre, who would you like to collab with which might&nbsp;surprise people?<br></strong></p>



<p>I&#8217;d like to collab with a person like FKJ or even the likes of Terrace Martin. They produce amazing music, in a way that&#8217;s&nbsp;very true to itself.&nbsp;</p>
