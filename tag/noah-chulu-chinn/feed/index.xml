<p>A South-Londener born and raised, Hillary started off in politics working as a parliamentary assistant to an MP. After learning how to code and helping out charities such as the Brixton Soup Kitchen, Hillary ventured into the world of technology and now works for the Mozilla Foundation; an organisation built on the belief that the internet should be free and open for everybody…</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hillary:</span> </strong>I&#8217;m currently working on something called the Common Voice project, which seeks to build foundational blocks for AI that could support speech technologies for languages across the world. Language is such a key part of our identity, who we are, how we transfer knowledge, how we connect to our culture and communities. Right now AI speech technologies such as Siri and Alexa have no African languages, so we work with a team of volunteers and language communities to contribute to this open-source project<strong>. </strong></p>

<p><strong>What’s your day-to-day life like at the moment? Are you doing more higher level policy and discourse related stuff or is there still room for some hardcore data science?</strong></p>



<p>Sadly this babe is not a data scientist! I’ve done some quantitative research as part of my degree but I’m not that confident in the coding languages commonly used for data science. It&#8217;s more that I engage with people who use the data (being collected for the common voice project) within the data science community.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>We’ve seen how the lack of diversity within the tech community can result in very serious implications in the ‘real-world’, what are your thoughts on that?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Firstly I think it is obviously really important that we have diverse teams, but also teams that are able to critically analyse the ways in which their power and privilege impacts what they&#8217;re working on.</p>
</div>

</div>
</div>



<p>You could have a diverse team in terms of protected characteristics such as race but still have a lack of representation of the working class.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There was a really good tweet that came up saying that while its good to encourage women to participate in STEM, if we’re not tackling sexual harassement, misogynoir etc. in the workplace then we’re not going to create a space in which they want to stay. Yes we need to tackle diversity but we need to also have safe spaces where people feel like they can contribute and bring different theories, because we are invaluable.</p>

<p>Me being a diasporan and coming from a Kenyan background, if I come into certain spaces as a westerner I&#8217;m going to center myself and not necessarily fit to other people&#8217;s needs. The fact that internet connectivity is good for me and not that expensive does not mean that it’s the same for my cousins back in Kenya, communities have different experiences and material things which they can access.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How has your dyslexia affected your path in tech? I’ve spoken to people who feel like their neurodivergence means that they can&#8217;t pursue a path into STEM.</strong></p>



<p>I&#8217;m not gonna lie… it is difficult. Learning how to code is hard and programs can break if you get one word wrong, one word!! So I found that I had to use little hacks that can help my own experience with dyslexia. </p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>



<p>Yes dyslexia affects the ways in which you process language but everyone&#8217;s experience is different, you need to figure out (with the help of communities) the ways in which you can be supported. It could be using cheat-sheets while learning how to code or use tools like speechify which produces spoken words from text (also made by someone who is dyslexic).&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Can you tell me about the project you founded called ‘Data Sistren’?</strong></p>



<p>It was a thing I started to share my explorations into data ethics, AI and our relationships with them. Its about using intersectional feminism as a way to expand the way I critique and analyse our relationship with data. I created a reading list on github and ran sessions talking about literature and topics about data. It&#8217;s great having a space to discuss these things, sometimes people talk about tech like it&#8217;s just a way to get money and it’s all just hype. I’ll have more content and events coming soon, keep posted!  </p>



<p><strong>Finally, whats going to be happening at the Old Kent Road Arts Club this Sunday?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>I’ve been planning an event called WorldWide Words with FAT studios, It focuses on the question of how we use our mother language online. Running a creative workshop which centres around discussion, play and debate. </p>

<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>It’s estimated that there are over 7000 languages spoken across the globe and a lot of the online world doesn’t represent that, so one of the things that this workshop aims to do is give us a space to reflect on the relationship between language, identity and the online world. I also want to highlight how other projects are working to reduce online language inequity, and give people the opportunity to contribute to the Common Voice project! </p>

<p>Born in Italy to Ghanaian parents, sound engineer Grace Esia is in her words a “Unicorn”. From dreaming of Beyonce to single handedly running the tech at the recent Bottle Factory event, Grace is force of nature who lights up whatever room she’s in. We sat down with her for a coffee to decompress after a hectic month, and find out how she became one of South-London&#8217;s most talented exports.</p>

<div class="wp-block-column">
<p><strong>So what brought you to London?</strong></p>



<p>I spent the first 15 years of my life in Italy. I moved to London around 8 years ago and have been here ever since. It was my parents decision really, there wasn’t a discussion it was “Your coming”. Essentially the economy was in a bad way in Italy, lack of Jobs and bad business…</p>



<p><strong>I’ve been to Italy a few times and obviously you hear stories..how was it growing up as a person of colour there?</strong></p>



<p>I feel like I grew up quite naively, my main concern back then was to be the popular girl that everybody liked, I didn’t see those nuances of me being a black person. I just had the regular issues that any other 12-year-old girl would have at that time, I didn’t&nbsp; really have a first hand experience of racism.</p>



<p>Coming to London was a big shock. I grew up being one of the only black people in my class and even the entire school, to being just anybody in&nbsp; South-East, one of many!</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="683" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sum2-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4596" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sum2-683x1024.jpg 683w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sum2-768x1152.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sum2-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sum2-1320x1980.jpg 1320w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sum2.jpg 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></figure>
</div>
</div>



<p><strong>And did that feel good?</strong></p>



<p>Ummm no.. I didn’t have many black friends in Italy and didn’t get to really experience the culture. Fast-forward to Catford, people weren’t that welcoming. In secondary school people would make fun of my accent, it was hard at first.</p>



<p><strong>I guess it can be hard to fit into the culture, even when you look like you should belong</strong></p>



<p>Exactly, I didn’t have a solid group of black friends till University. The realisation when I clocked that I had found my clique, “I’ve got black friends!!!”</p>

<div class="wp-block-column">
<p><strong>So when did the music start? </strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>So of course I wanted to be Beyonce, I remember I got this one compliment and I thought “Okay cool that’s my life’s purpose”. Studying music in Italy is quite different compared to London, the education system is completely different. For me to pursue a music career and study I would of had to go to a conservatoire, and I wasn’t about to do that…. I took that little dream and put it in a box for a while.</p>



<p>When I moved to London I realised how easier and less stressful it was to have music classes etcetera, so I opened up that box! So I studied Music Performance in college and then switched to production in Uni.</p>



<p><strong>What caused that switch to production?</strong></p>



<p>I definitely still consider myself an artist and do want to release music, but I had a sound engineering module in college and absolutely loved it. </p>
</div>
</div>



<p>Being in the studio…Mic’ing up, it was so much fun. When I was looking into it I found out about Rick Rubin (Def Jam founder and influential producer), the point is he doesn’t really do much on the console, he’s more of an idea’s guy who helps shape the music.</p>



<p>Then I decided to switch to production, studying performance didn’t really make sense to me and I didn’t feel like I needed a piece of paper which said OK I can sing songs. I wanted to get the technical stuff down. I then moved onto live sound engineering which I love, I guess its kind-of a back-up plan but I can see myself doing shows, festivals, travelling around. My plan is that I’ll be an Audio Engineer and if I then blow up and become the next Beyonce, So be it !!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sum1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4610" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sum1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sum1-768x512.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sum1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sum1-1320x880.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>I feel like there’s a stereotype of ‘The Sound Guy’, is this something you’ve had to deal with in the past?</strong></p>



<p>Here’s the thing, when it comes to anything technical, there is not much female representation, let alone black female representation. Everyone does assume that the person doing the sound is a guy… but it doesn’t bother me too much, be the change you want to see right? I don’t want it to affect me and think ‘Oh my god why do they think I’m going to be a man’, instead I’ll just show up, do my job and show them that I know what I’m doing.</p>



<p>I do wonder why it’s the case, why must any technical, science-related job be only for men to pursue? I’m hoping that with time passing it will change, and I guess my presence will help that.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="683" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sum7-1-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4612" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sum7-1-683x1024.jpg 683w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sum7-1-768x1152.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sum7-1-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sum7-1-1320x1980.jpg 1320w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sum7-1.jpg 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></figure>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<p><strong>Are there opportunities and programs to help people like you in the music industry?</strong></p>



<p>Mmmmmmmm (<em>big pause)….</em>No. When you ask me that question I’m thinking of organisations or projects and I can’t see them. It’s different for an artist to find opportunities and schemes compared to a lawyer, there’s less of an establishment. And it’s the same with being a black tech, there’s not an establishment I can go to and say “I’m a black female tech, help me out!!!”. You have to scavenge and research.</p>



<p>Although I did get lucky, during the black lives matter protests the musicians <em>Nao </em>and <em>Mura Masa </em>created a ten-week course for black women in music tech (<a href="https://www.nativemgmt.co.uk/3t">3T</a>). Which is something that was unheard of. I was super lucky to be a part of that.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p><strong>It’s mad that the murder of a black man halfway across the world had to be the catalyst for projects like that.</strong></p>



<p>You know what I mean??? But I’m very grateful for what that project gave me, it activated a domino effect which led me to getting a job as an engineer. But at the same time, it shouldn’t have to be like that. I wish it was normalised, I am an actual unicorn! Don’t get me wrong, it feels great and I love the attention, but why? Comments like “oh wow you’re actually really good at your job”. Okay I get it I’m smart, beautiful, crazy and sexy but it shouldn’t be so special for me to be a tech!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sumgrace-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4616" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sumgrace-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sumgrace-768x576.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sumgrace-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sumgrace-1320x990.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>I feel like I’m more of an ideas person, I love singing and free-flowing thoughts. But I wanted to force myself to learn the technical stuff behind the music. There needs to be a balance between the two sides of music which I just don’t think is there yet. You can have all these people with amazing ideas, but how are you doing it without knowing the equipment behind it?</p>

<p>The self-styled Philosopher King, Deji is a multi-talented Neuroscientist with interests in the bridge between neuroscience, computing and theoretical physics. Starting on Deji’s interests in his field, our conversation soon turned to theoretical neuroscience and consciousness, all without an old white man in sight…</p>

<p><strong>What are you up to at the moment?</strong></p>



<p>Right now I’ve just finished my exams, which is a massive release. Other than that, just working on my music, I’ve got a song coming out <em>Momento Mouri</em>, which I’m releasing on my birthday.</p>



<p>My masters is going good, I’m basically two thirds of the way, the only thing I’ve got left is my dissertation. I focused on neuroimaging for one third of my degree, which is a class of techniques to get images of the brain. There’s different ways to do it… most people have heard of MRI but there are loads of other ways to do it, its all super interesting stuff and I’m sure it will be useful for the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>So what’s the plan for the future then?</strong></p>



<p>For my project I’m going to be analysing brain data from people who have taken LSD and DMT, and doing some machine learning analysis and computational modelling on the info.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">

</div>
</div>



<p>Hopefully afterwards I’ll find work as a research assistant and then potentially do a PhD, we’ll see how things go.</p>



<p><strong>How did you get into neuroscience in the first place?</strong></p>



<p>My bachelors was in sociology and psychology, my Uni journey is pretty jokes. I’ve always been into philosophy so that was what I originally aimed to study and I originally got into UCL for it, but I was always that kid to didn’t work hard enough but just coasted by and I didn’t end up getting the grades to actually go there. I didn’t even know what I was thinking but my sister was just like <em>“Study something..just go to Uni”</em>, so I ended up doing a criminology course at Kent, to be honest I couldn’t even tell you what criminology was about when I started there other than what the name suggests.</p>



<p>I met a couple people at Uni who were doing psychology and it looked tempting… I had spent the summer before watching all these Darren Brown videos and thought this was what doing psychology could lead to! So I switched and when I started learning more about psychology and it’s basis…the Brain. By my second year I was really getting into neuroscience, reading all the popular books and decided that’s what I was going to do in my life.</p>



<p>It’s interesting because although my journey hasn’t been very typical, every time I reach I different step in education I uncover a bit more about what I really want to do. From philosophy to philosophy of the mind to psychology to neuroscience… and now theoretical neuroscience. It was a natural progression.</p>



<p><strong>Yeah I feel like although they’re different subjects they all lead into each other nicely. Looking at the brain… how it works, then you get into consciousness and the Hard Problem, it all makes sense.</strong></p>



<p><strong>What’s messed up with our educational system though is the fact that you have to almost decided what you want to do in life when you’re taking your GCSE’s…</strong></p>



<p>I completely agree, if you want to do a specialist subject at Uni you could have to make the decision at 16-years old!</p>



<p>Although there are merits to the system because I was able to switch around. My A-levels were very much humanities-based and I didn’t really know what science was. So I’m very grateful that I was able to cross over into the world of science.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sum3-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3567" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sum3-768x1024.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sum3-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sum3-1320x1760.jpg 1320w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sum3.jpg 1537w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<p><strong>I feel like that’s more of a merit to you though, rather than how easy it is. I doubt the average person would be able to seamlessly switch from humanities to neuroscience. Like you said you read loads of literature and did your own research and hustle…. hats off to you.</strong></p>



<p>To be honest I wouldn’t even see it as work. That’s the beauty of when you’re really passionate about something, it’s almost as if its not you doing the reading or you doing the work… you just <strong><em>do </em></strong>it, you’re almost a passive observer.</p>



<p>I had this in an exam recently, I was just really enjoying it to the point where I was almost watching myself do it.</p>



<p><strong>I know what you mean, I wouldn’t class doing physics as <em>work </em>per se. Slyly I’d get enjoyment out of revising and even doing exams. Obviously if it’s a hard exam and you’re doing shit it’s a different story…. But I know that feeling.</strong></p>
</div>
</div>



<p><strong>So what is the biggest thing you’re interested in neuroscience right now?</strong></p>



<p>I’m really into something called the Free Energy Principle. It’s a <strong><em>Bayesian Brian Hypothesis </em></strong>(<em>Bayes theorem is a way of calculating conditional probability&#8230; Such as the probability of a patient having liver disease on the <strong>condition</strong> that they are an alcoholic</em>).</p>



<p>It basically states that the way the brain is constantly updating is by using Bayes Rule, literally plugging in your prior beliefs into to this theorem to achieve a prediction. This is the most fundamental thing the brain does, from the level of <em>Am I looking at a phone right now? </em>To the level of <em>Should I apply for a PhD?</em></p>



<p><strong>How would you even go about investigating something like that?</strong></p>



<p>This is why it’s such a hot topic and why some people are against it. The reason why it is true is not because of experimental evidence, it’s because of it’s mathematical soundness. The reason why people assume the brain is doing Bayesian inference (<em>the brain uses bayes theorem to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence comes in… eg. You see a cat, then you smell cat shit, then there’s some brown stuff on your bed.. the brain will be using bayes theorem to continuously update the likelihood that said cat has shat on your bed)</em>, is because it’s the most mathematically simple way to describe what’s going on.</p>



<p><strong>So this is obviously a highly theoretical description of how the brain works&#8230; How does this translate into an explanation into how the brain actual <em>does </em>that? From my limited knowledge I know that lots of processes in the brain aren’t even well understood.</strong></p>



<p><strong>This almost treats the brain as a computing machine, how does this theoretical model cope with the fact that some people are able to predict things better than other people, or variations in intelligence and understanding of the world?</strong></p>



<p>The way that the Bayesian inference occurs is through different synaptic connections (<em>the junctions that connect neurons, cells which use electrical impulses and chemical signals to transmit info around the brain)</em>. By strengthening or weakening these synaptic connections the brain updates prior information to obtain a prediction. Under this framework “Intelligence” would be your brain’s ability to alter these connections in order to adjust your prior beliefs in the most logical way. Everyone has variations in brain anatomy, which would affect their ability to update their prior beliefs to form a sensible prediction.</p>



<p>This could also account mental health disorders like schizophrenia, in this framework someone with schizophrenia would not have strong prior beliefs. An example would be auditory hallucinations, someone with strong prior beliefs would determine that a voice in their head is actually them, whereas someone with schizophrenia could determine that this “voice” is actually someone or something else (<strong><em>N: </em></strong><em>I tried to imagine a situation where my mind is wiped. If I then saw a plane, my lack of strong prior beliefs could lead me to infer that the plane was actually a flying monster which would soon eject cats to shit on my bed)</em>.</p>



<p>The other side of the spectrum is something like depression, instead of the problem of not having strong prior beliefs, it’s that your prior beliefs are too strong. Your depressing thoughts of worthlessness and sadness are then constraining the way you view evidence way more than the should. It’s interesting because there are studies that show that depressed individuals actually have a more accurate view of reality. Now let’s look at how psychedelics are used as a treatment for depression. It increases the entropy of the brain, the amount of different states a brain can be in. This means that the depressive priors are being diluted by the increase of different states, when people say the have a “new view of life” after taking psychedelics, they are literally using different synaptic connections to make predictions.</p>



<p><strong>That’s actually mad, I’ve never heard it be explained like that before. But how do you conduct boots on the ground research into this?</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>For my dissertation I will be taking brain data from people taking LSD and DMT, I would then measure the entropy of the brain. Looking at the connectivity patterns between different regions of the brain, people who have taken psychedelics should have a much wider array of communication patterns between different regions, which implies that the number of micro-states the brain can be in has increased (<em>another way of saying entropy has increased)</em>.</p>



<p>I think the beauty is that compared to other disciplines neuroscience is so young, we don’t know how far we can push the theoretical side of it, we’ve just started! When you compare it to theoretical physicists who can make predictions which take decades for experiments to prove (e.g. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/02/12/einstein-predicted-gravitational-waves-100-years-ago-heres-what-it-took-to-prove-him-right/">Einsteins gravitational wave</a>), we haven’t reached that stage with neuroscience yet and I’m excited to see what happens.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sum1-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3572" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sum1-768x1024.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sum1-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sum1-1320x1760.jpg 1320w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sum1.jpg 1537w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>
</div>
</div>



<p><strong>But is comparing neuroscience with physics the right way? Once you get to a biological system like the brain, do we have the ability to predict and model things by boiling down to fundamental mathematics? I can use a computer to model some particles moving around in a box, but how can I model something so impossibly complex as the brain?</strong></p>



<p>I don’t think so. It’s like any other science, we can’t see the answers until we get there, we can’t compute something….until we can. If you had asked <a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/james-clerk-maxwell-a-force-for-physics/">James Maxwell</a> about Quantum Mechanics he would have been baffled! We’re in a similar situation now with neuroscience, we’re limited by the technology, it takes time.</p>



<p>And you don’t have to go to a fine-grain approach as particles, instead you could use molecules or chemicals as the fundamental “unit” and just treat the brain as a chemical soup. As you said,</p>



<p>sometimes it’s easier to use statistical methods when faced with modelling a large collection of particles. I think with time things will get better and I feel super-interested in pursuing it, there’s so much more things to learn and I can’t wait</p>

</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<p><strong>If we were eventually able to mathematical model everything that’s going on in the brain, would we then be able to essentially re-create a human mind on a computer?</strong></p>



<p>I think there’s two elements to it. There’s the element of you being able to reproduce the human brain within a computer, using fundamental Axioms (established truth) which describe how the brain works. Then there’s being able to individually map someone’s neurological make-up and “upload” that to a computer.</p>



<p>I think we’re mostly likely to get to the first one, understand the fundamentals of the brain and how consciousness pops out as the end result.</p>



<p>I’m a materialist, I believe we’re made out of matter and there’s not some magic thing that’s going on behind the scenes.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>BUT.. consciousness is immaterial, it’s abstract, there’s not one place or time where you can say consciousness <em>Is</em>. You can say you are conscious in <em>this</em> moment in <em>this</em> body, but consciousness itself is not in one particular place, or else you could break it down into composite parts, and you can’t.</p>



<p><strong>How does consciousness come into play when looking at the Many Worlds Interpretation? </strong><em>(this interpretation of Quantum Mechanics implies that all possible outcomes of a quantum measurement are realised in countless other “worlds” or universes, in one world the cat shits on my bed, in another it shits on my sofa)</em></p>



<p>To be honest that is a problem hahaha, I’m not sure!! I guess I’m going to say that right now I don’t see any way of proving or disproving the interpretation using experiment, so let’s cross that bridge when we get to it!</p>



<p>Consciousness is the result of evolution across millions or billions of years, we don’t have that time! We’ve only got one lifetime each to work on it. Obviously you can pass on the baton and share knowledge and information, but maybe there just isn’t enough batons…</p>

<p>Currently working as a Data scientist for a company that provides Covid-19 screening services, Axel is a biomedical scientist whose past research includes studies on bacteria involved in cystic fibrosis, and anti-microbial products. After touching on his work, Axel speaks on his experiences in science, imposter syndrome, and the lack of POC representation in the scientific curriculum.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns collapse-above-right">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Noah:</span> When did you decide that you wanted to become a Scientist?</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Axel:</span> I didn’t really see myself taking research further until 3<sup>rd</sup> year, during my research project. The project was researching different anti-microbials, looking at products made by a chemist at UCLAN (University of Central Lancashire), and seeing if they could kill a broad range of microbes. My supervisor, Dr Garcia-Lara, was a huge help and mentor and I guess my he saw something in me… he had read a report I wrote in 2<sup>nd</sup> year and persuaded me to do a project with him, which translated into a summer internship and eventually a year-long position. While at the position I was also looking at biofilms, how microbial organisms interact and form complex communities on surfaces, research important to understanding infections and diseases like cystic fibrosis.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/axel2-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2305" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/axel2-768x1024.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/axel2-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/axel2-1320x1760.jpg 1320w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/axel2.jpg 1537w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>
</div>
</div>



<p>All this work then fed into my master’s project at Liverpool, where I was looking at a certain bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa which are notorious for forming biofilms in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. We were trying to find how Pseudomonas aeruginosa displaces the normal resident bacteria to form a persistent infection.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">N:</span> So after finishing your Master’s where do you see yourself going?</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A:</span> Ha well that’s the golden question! Can you answer it for me? I’m at that point where I’m thinking shall I do a PhD? Shall I wait a bit get some more work experience? Or shall I do something completely different?</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">N:</span> No clue! I’ll give you a hand once I sort my life out</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A:</span> There’s loads of different avenues that are not made obvious at university. Academics at these institutions obviously will try to tell about all the opportunities out there, but if they’ve been in academia their whole life they might even not know the full picture, they’re restricted to what they know.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/dude-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2311" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/dude-768x1024.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/dude-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/dude-1320x1760.jpg 1320w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/dude.jpg 1537w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">N:</span> So for me as an outsider, I would say that the Life Sciences seem to have a better track record when considering diversity…at least compared to physics and chemistry. Would you say that’s the case from what you’ve experienced?<br><strong><br></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A:</span> I’d definitely say that’s the case when we talk about degrees like medicine or dentistry, I think that probably has to do with immigrant families holding the title of “Dr” or “Dentist” to very high regard, &#8217;cause they know that once that child graduates, they’ll have a vocation which makes them a decent amount of money and can pull themselves out of whatever situation they might be in. When it comes to biomedicine a lot of people take it as a route to become a medical doctor, so you can still see fair amounts of diversity of there, however there is a huge gap in people of colour going from undergraduate degrees to research roles and PhDs, there’s waaaay less.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">N:</span> What was your experience as a researcher at Lancashire and Liverpool, did you feel yourself as being a bit of an anomaly within the demographic?</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A:</span> At Liverpool I think I can safely say I was the only black male on my course, I was definitely the only black male in my lab. I think there was an African PhD student somewhere in the building because I bumped into him once and he tried to get me to go to his church, but that’s it.</p>



<p>It’s hard, in any lab its just the norm for me to be the only black person, it’s what I’ve come to expect. But I didn’t really feel like an “outsider”, except when I was doing my internships. You get the whole imposter syndrome creeping in… do I really belong here? Why have they chosen me? I’ve never met a single black male with my kind of accent in those research environments. You feel like you have to work harder than your peers, so that you don’t somehow reinforce someone’s prejudice in their head, it’s not a good feeling.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns collapse-below-right">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">N:</span> What do you think the reason behind the cut-off of people of colour not going further in their academic career?</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A:</span> Well I do say there is some diversity that takes courses like Bio-med and Medicine, but I think its still not amazing. I can’t really say there’s one reason and one part where there is a cut-off. It’s more as you go up the rungs in academia, they’ll just be smaller and smaller fractions. If I had to isolate a single point it would probably be from school to higher education. Everyone has to take a science GCSE, but then non-white students studying STEM only make up 6.2% of the total university intake (Less than half of the percentage of the non-white English population, 14.6%).</p>

<div class="wp-block-column">

<p>I think it’s a multi-variate problem. You’re going to have low expectations amongst our communities if not that many make it to higher education and have notable achievements in science. One of the biggest issues is definitely the lack of role models, which causes the whole thing to become a bi-directional problem… lack of representation causes low expectations and diminished interest in science, which in turns causes lack of representation. As a black boy if you don’t see anyone having those high-level roles you’re not going to expect yourself to ever make it in the first place, I mean we don’t even learn ANYTHING about black science history. I would have to use my own initiative to find any number of great black scientists who should be held to the same regard as the Darwins and Newtons that we are expected to study.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">N:</span> Definitely, Or even higher considering the obstacles they would have had to face</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A:</span> There’s some amazing black scientists whose work has been instrumental in shaping modern society and we know nothing about them. Don’t mention them in the curriculum just because they were black, mention them because they played such an important role in the subjects that you’re teaching us. Just doing that would let young black students know that there is nothing out of the ordinary about a person of colour being a scientist. Type in black scientists into google and you’ll get a list of all these people, it&#8217;s just a shame you have to put in the word “black” to find them. &nbsp;</p>



<p><em>As Axel pointed out, during a British school education it is hard (or impossible) to recall a time when a black scientist is mentioned. Ironically the awarding body OCR has even written a blog about black British scientists for black history month (</em><a href="https://www.ocr.org.uk/blog/six-black-british-pioneers-of-stem/"><em>https://www.ocr.org.uk/blog/six-black-british-pioneers-of-stem/</em></a><em>) but still fails to actually include any of these pioneers in the general curriculum. If you want to find out more about notable black scientists, check out this article on researchers at Cambridge University (</em><a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/bhmresearchers"><em>https://www.cam.ac.uk/bhmresearchers</em></a><em>) (to note: from 2012-2016 one college in Cambridge did not offer a single place to a black applicant)</em></p>

<p>If you’re from a city like London, you can forget that not every part of the UK and Europe is a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities. School trips outside of the capital can be stark reminders that in many parts of the western world, the presence of a person of colour can still garner curiosity and on some occasions genuine hostility.</p>



<p>Originating from Edinburgh, Kimberley Hoyle moved to London in 2016 to pursue a career in the performing arts, experiencing a massive change in her local demographics as a result (8.3% of the Edinburgh population are non-white, compared to 40.2% of London’s population). We sat down with Kimberley to hear about how her experiences differed from that of a Londoner, and how the recent BLM movement allowed her to be better equipped to look back at her childhood with a more critical and informed gaze.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns collapse-above-right">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>Noah: Hey! So tell me a bit about yourself, what are you doing at the moment? </p>



<p>Kimberly: Ha well right now I’m doing ab-so-lute-ly nothing… but if it wasn’t for Covid I’d be auditioning, taping, trying to get a performing job. I grew up in Edinburgh and moved to London in 2016 after doing a year at a performing arts school just outside of Glasgow. I wouldn’t really put myself down as being just a “dancer”, but that’s what I grew doing and have most experience in at the moment.</p>



<p>My Dad grew up in Edinburgh and has family from England, while my Mum is originally from Nigeria and move here when she was around 14. Growing up in Edinburgh was fine for me, I never envisioned myself moving away so young. My sister was always the more confident one who was going to be the singer, I was shyer… just plodding along.</p>

</div>



<p>N: What was it like being a mix-raced child growing up, I can’t imagine you were one of many?&nbsp;</p>



<p>K: So there really weren’t many non-white kids around me, I’m pretty sure me and my sister were the only children of African heritage in primary school, until around the age of 8 when a mix-raced girl called Katie joined. The fact that I know her name (she wasn’t in the same year) kind of shows how that there really wasn’t anyone else that looked like us.</p>



<p>In High School I honestly can’t remember if there were any black or mix-race pupils, but each time I come back to Edinburgh now it seems more and more diverse. In my head I wonder if it was really was like that when I was young&#8230;in school, you just stay with the same group of friends in the same area, maybe there were other people like me but I just never realised. It’s only when you reach 17 or 18 that you start to go out and explore a bit more of the city, but I only had a year of that until I moved down to London.</p>

</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>N: Were you conscious of the fact that you were the only person of colour around in your school?<br><br>K: I think it was easy to ignore until I was about 14 or 15. If you had asked me a couple years ago, I would have said that I didn’t experience any racism and school was generally fine for me. But after educating myself in recent years I can say that I definitely did experience prejudice, maybe I did feel hurt after things were said or done, maybe I just pushed it down as I was the minority, and these things were being said by my friends and peers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The BLM movement helped me understand what words like micro-aggressions and colourism meant, and after posting about it I did have friends from home who reached out to have a discussion about their part in not only being racist but also not calling it out. Some assured me that they would never allow their children to get away with the things that they said to me, which I think is much better than apologising for the racist joke they said 5 years ago when they were 16.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>N: I think it’s hard at that age to turn around and say to your friends that their joke was racist, you don’t want to make your hurt obvious and call them out for it. I definitely still struggle to have a voice and call people out if they’re not my close friends.</p>



<p>K: I’m not sure how badly I was affected by it all and I wouldn’t say I had a bad childhood because of my race or anything, I&#8217;m still incredibly proud to be Scottish. I know people that have experienced a lot of racism and had a shit time, I wouldn’t say that’s me. I can definitely remember specific times where I was genuinely hurt, comments like “You’re fit for a black girl” and “When you go black you never go back” of course affected me and made me feel uncomfortable.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>I can’t speak for every person of colour who went to my school before or afterwards, and I can’t speak for everyone who has been through the Scottish school system, but my personal experience was generally positive…apart from the occasional “joke”.</p>



<p>There was a thing about a hoodie. I was really into gymnastics when I was younger, and you know Jackie Chan, he’s got all the moves and is big in Karate or whatever. For my leavers hoodie I had “Blackie Chan” printed on the back&#8230;because it was a friend’s nickname for me.<br><br>N: I know you implied that adults weren’t really complicit what you experienced and that it was your friends jokes that made you feel uncomfortable. but for me that shows that adults were definitely aware of what you were experiencing. Surely your teacher saw that hoodie, they printed it for you after all?</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="683" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kimberly4-1-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2203" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kimberly4-1-683x1024.jpg 683w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kimberly4-1-768x1152.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kimberly4-1.jpg 828w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></figure>
</div>
</div>



<p>K: That is true, a lot of the names that were handed in were not allowed by the teachers. Maybe It was because the name was from me, it was my submission, so they thought it wouldn’t be their place to tell me not to have such a racist name printed? I’m not sure what their thought process was but looking back I do think that it shouldn’t have been allowed.</p>



<p>This is the first time I’ve really looked back and spoken about growing up in Edinburgh, looking back on it with a more informed lens. With my friends who spoke to me during the BLM movement, I always tried to say that if I can take control and educate myself, so can they. Not being around people of colour isn’t an excuse to not learn about their experiences in our country. You’re in a bubble regarding any issue, both physical and digital, but all the relevant information is out there… you might just need a little nudge in the right direction.</p>

<p>Hope is a PhD student studying the Neuroscience behind the perception of music and sound. When not looking at people’s brains (I forgot to ask if she’s ever touched one and what they smell like, sorry everyone), Hope also is the Founder and Director of Thinking Black,&nbsp; a social enterprise aiming to empower and amplify young black voices through education and mentorship. In a wide-ranging discussion, Hope touched upon how money can affect people’s perception of what is “Human” and how the effects of discrimination can effect everything from healthcare to Artificial intelligence.</p>



<p><strong>Tell me about yourself, how did you get to where you are now?</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>I’m from Newham in East London and went to a school that used to be pretty bad….but then got turned around by a “Super-Headteacher”. At 6<sup>th</sup>-form I got pulled aside one day and was told that I should apply for Biology at Oxford University, but I knew that my parents wouldn’t let me study anything but Medicine, Engineering or Law. So my teacher had to pretty much convince my mum that going to Oxford to study Biology was actually pretty good ! After a bit I then switched to neuroscience.</p>



<p>Once I graduated I went to New York &nbsp;where I was a junior research associate in a lab. It was a really cool experience, I helped PhD students set up and run their experiments and had a team of undergrads working under me too which was fun.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="923" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hope2020-923x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1977" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hope2020-923x1024.jpg 923w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hope2020-768x852.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hope2020-1384x1536.jpg 1384w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hope2020-1320x1465.jpg 1320w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hope2020.jpg 1846w" sizes="(max-width: 923px) 100vw, 923px" /></figure>
</div>
</div>



<p>The research was looking at the neuroscience behind implicit bias, my project was looking at perceptions of economic scarcity and seeing if this perceived scarcity increased a subject’s tendency to discriminate against black people.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>How does one set-up an experiment like that ?</strong></p>



<p>We would tell a subject “Due to the economic crash, we’ve reduced the amount of money in a particular fund”. I would then use photoshop to merge people’s faces to create varying levels of features associated with black people. The subject would be presented with the different faces and let them decide how much of the money they would allocate to the different people.</p>



<p>The subjects were placed in an fMRI scanner (used to measure brain activity) while making these decisions. Essentially it was found that the area of the brain that associated with response to faces had a different pattern of activity when looking at black faces when the scarcity manipulation was run. This activity matches what is seen when people are presented with things that are “human-like” or not quite human. The overarching&nbsp; takeaway was that when there is a perception of economic scarcity, white people tend to de-humanise black faces.</p>



<p><strong>Were the subjects of the experiment only white ? It would be interesting to see how black people would react…to see whether the de-humanisation comes from not growing up around people of different races, or if it’s due to the way black people are generally perceived in society.</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, but this is the thing. It was frustrating as it only told half the story and within that we only tested university students, which are obviously a very particular subset of people… white, wealthy, quite liberal…and then make these sweeping statements. I kept asking of we could run the experiment on black people… but unfortunately hit a dead end. It is quite scary how talking about&nbsp; money can affect the way you perceive people, and literally see them as less human.&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<p><strong>And what about now? What’s your PhD project about?</strong></p>



<p>My PhD is in auditory neuroscience, the science of sound and music and how we perceive them. I work with the Ecological Brain Project (https://ecologicalbrain.org/about/), which tries to conduct studies in real world settings. So instead of having experiments where subjects are in a massive scanner making decisions on how big a circle is, we try to look at people in natural settings making more realistic decisions.</p>



<p><strong>How was your experience studying at Oxford ?</strong></p>



<p>It was&#8230;weird. I met amazing people and neuroscience was interesting and I loved it. But there is a whole lot of white people and not much else. I experienced lots of microaggressions… things like security asking for my ID when I was 10 steps behind a white person who was allowed to go unbothered…or confusing me with the one other black girl in my college and giving her my mail. Just lots of little things that made me feel really visible.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p><strong>So did you feel quite exposed there ?</strong></p>



<p>Exactly! Like I was walking around naked the whole time. Oxford gets lots of tourists and they would sometimes take pictures of me. Once the ACS (African Caribbean Society) was doing a photoshoot for a campaign, and we had a massive group of tourists with their cameras snapping away….</p>



<p>I successfully ran for JCR president (head of the undergraduate student body) so I could “change Oxford from the inside” and worked to write in legislation, start committees and funds, which is how <strong>Thinking Black </strong>was created.</p>



<p><strong>How successful were your attempts after reaching this position of Power ?</strong></p>



<p>I felt that as I was one of the only black people in my college, I had a responsibility to use this position to help other black students, it wasn’t just a box-ticker for my CV and looking back, I think it was successful. We set-up loads of mental health initiatives and wrote in legislations to help students suspend their studies if they were struggling for different reasons. One of the things I’m proud of is helping to set-up a scholarship for asylum seekers living in Britain.</p>



<p>However, there were lots of things where they (the governing body of the college)dragged their heels and slowed down these changes. They know that you’re only in this position for one year, and it seemed that sometimes they were just hoping for me to give up and move on.The people who run the college are mainly white men who deny or at least feign ignorance when told that the college had a race problem. They would say things like “No-one’s ever raised an issue before”…Look around ! It’s because you all look the same! That’s the problem!</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p><strong>What is Thinking Black ?</strong></p>



<p>Thinking Black is an educational project for young black students with the goal being to support and uplift young black voices, which I founded while studying at Oxford. We’re trying to provide skills training to black students, lessons in writing, public speaking and lectures in art history in an effort to empower them to communicate in lots of different forms and give them the confidence to do so.</p>



<p>I’m a neuroscientist but I love other things like art and reading, and these are skills, which can be employed in any setting. As a young Nigerian I never considered a more creative career as being something I could do, or even why it would be hobby that was worthwhile doing. I think that through the act of doing these kinds of subjects you can learn so much. The education we provide is centred around black academics and content that relates to black people.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="714" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hope3-714x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1985" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hope3-714x1024.jpg 714w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hope3-768x1101.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hope3-1071x1536.jpg 1071w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hope3-1320x1893.jpg 1320w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hope3.jpg 1429w" sizes="(max-width: 714px) 100vw, 714px" /></figure>
</div>
</div>



<p>For example if you look at the way that black people are depicted in art in the past couple of centuries, you can start to unpack the ways that black people are depicted in modern times too. It is kind of arty but we do science stuff too. We also need to talk about race in health science, race in AI and how climate change effects black and indigenous groups.</p>



<p><strong>Definitely, I think now more than ever race is involved in science. You mentioned AI and healthcare, the possibility of people encoding racial bias into an algorithm which could be used to identify criminals is insane (</strong><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03186-4"><strong>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03186-4</strong></a><strong>), while there is a mountain of evidence of how black people can be discriminated against when accessing healthcare.</strong></p>



<p>There are so may devastating things that make this obvious, such as increased maternal mortality in ethnic minorities. How race can affect how people are treated… there are obviously sometimes very good reasons for it but it definitely needs to be assessed and re-examined. When you look at the history of medicine, some of these ideas and theories can be traced back to Eugenics.</p>



<p><strong>When you say you didn’t consider more creative subjects “As a young Nigerian”, do you mean in a sense that it was your upbringing that prevented you, not the fact that you are black and would therefore have less opportunities than your white counterparts.</strong></p>



<p>I think its both. Obviously the classic lack of representation and role models growing up does not help, but it was also definitely the Nigerian and possibly generally immigrant family attitude of wanting financial security for their children. My dad literally sat me down and said I shouldn’t consider certain types of jobs as “black people won’t flourish”, he said what I need is education and security. That’s why they love vocational jobs, once you get that qualification, that degree, nobody can take that away from you. I think it comes from being protective and a fear of their children failing due to the odds being stacked against them, and us as children internalise that fear.</p>

<div class="wp-block-column">
<p><strong>What do you have on at the moment and what’s next for Thinking Black?</strong></p>



<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>We just finished our year 12 writing project, where they had a batch of lectures and seminars and then wrote up their essays. We had different modules on health and equality, racial justice, climate change, art and culture and black feminism… it was really cool. &nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve got funding from my Oxford College to fund prizes and competitions and are expanding into different subjects and ideas. We’re working towards researching wider inequalities between students of different races, and it would be amazing to present the findings to different educational bodies so that they could use that sort of data to make real change, in a sense we’re working towards making projects like Thinking Black obsolete!</p>

<div id="vimeoyo2" style="position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/413128181?color=d42929&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;height:100%;" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>



<p>DJAO is a poignant short film depicting the life of a young migrant from the Ivory Coast named Mamadou. It expresses the struggles of his past and how he tries to navigate relocating to France, whilst bearing the weight of being undocumented. The film finds a balance between the weighted emotions of Mamadou&#8217;s life, whilst finding small moments of solace in his love of dance as a form of self-expression. We sat down with the director Loïc Phil to discuss the work behind the moving film.</p>



<p>Noah: So tell me about DJAO. How did you go about making it, how did this start?</p>



<p>Loïc: The original idea was to make some nice soft thing and I didn&#8217;t have many ideas. I wanted to make something about dance actually. I also had a friend of mine who was a part of an association whose goal is to build a network, linking people, a solidarity network. So the idea is if you are poor, or maybe a migrant, you don&#8217;t have commitments, life is hard&#8230; but it will be a lot easier if you have all your people around to help you. Even just a friend or people to advise you. The goal was to make solidarity among people. I asked if maybe we could make a documentary mixing dance and migration. So she told me that they had a workshop and they had made a show where migrants were dancing. There was one guy, Mamadou, I learned that he could dance and he had kind of a weird energy. So she gave me his contact and then we met and we talked. And then we decided to make the documentary.  It was really supposed to be more linked to dance you know? Like half dancing and the rest was supposed to be around migration.</p>



<p>N: And so then it morphed into more of a study about this particular person?</p>



<p>L: Yeah. So basically what happened is, so first it&#8217;s a stupid thing, but I think it it had lots of impact on the film. The first thing is that, during this period, there were lots of big strikes in France, where all the transportation was closed and then everything else was closed, so it was a shitty moment to organise parties for dancing. No-one was going to the parties because there was no buses or transportation. So that removed slightly the dancing part. The other thing that happened was, when we started to talk about the film he was waiting for his documents. And when you are waiting for the documents, you have paper documents that says you are illegal. At the middle of the pre-production his documents weren&#8217;t sorted, so he started to be defined as undocumented. So what started as &#8220;He can move wherever he wants&#8221;, &#8220;He can do whatever he wants&#8221;  turned to be &#8220;oh shit, we are stuck and we cannot move in the same way&#8221;, he couldn&#8217;t go out of the house. He was really scared of meeting the police. And so, it changed form, the shape of the film.</p>



<p>The last thing was, we met four or five times three, we drank coffee and he told me about his life, it was really intense and there was lots of things you can&#8217;t even imagine because he has such a crazy story. His history was way more important and way more powerful than just a dance, even if I wanted to make dance film, I couldn&#8217;t. The first time I saw him dance was during the shooting of the film. So naturally the dance came out and his history was in the movement, that&#8217;s how it happened.</p>



<p>N: Although you said it didn&#8217;t become a dance film, for me the the part of the film which triggered the most emotion was actually the dancing, like when they go to the club and listen to Ivorian music. That was the bit that really hit me. I think what was cool was that a lot of films are about a migrants pain and the struggle and they never show how they can still enjoy themselves, still have reasonable life where you can have fun and dance and drink. I thought that was a really powerful moment.</p>



<p>L: Thank you, that&#8217;s great. I think the topic of the film is not even about migration, it&#8217;s like a sub topic. The real topic is you&#8217;re carrying stuff, you know bad stuff, everyone has shitty experiences, sadness.. pain.. maybe your girlfriend broken up with you, maybe something happened to your family. Everyone carries something you know? We are all doing things&#8230; to escape. And so the story of Mamadou is the story of a guy who is trying to be released from some shitty things in his life and is trying to create steps, trying to move past times where he was stuck. Sometimes when we spoke you could tell his mind drifted to his past. So he is moving away from his past you know, from what is bad in his life.</p>



<p>Dance was the link, the bridge between pure presence and home. When you dance, you are present, you are drawing the present moment and you are living it fully &#8211; and at the same moment, for him, dance was representing his native country, listening to Ivorian music, he was thinking about his origin and not in a negative way, not about the police, murder or of his migration. He was thinking about his nature and simply enjoying it. The purity of his home, not just the bad memories.</p>



<p>N: That&#8217;s such a good point. Even listening to you explain it to me makes me already see it in a new light. How long did the film take to make, what was the process of that?</p>



<p>L: So as I said there were the strikes in France. Things were kind of slow, the pace and the progression of the film. Instead of just seeing him in like two weeks, it took us like maybe a month and a half to talk, because it was all so slow in France. I had to cycle an hour to go see him and yeah, at the same time he was kind of scared. A big stress was when he found that he couldn&#8217;t have his documents. There was maybe three weeks where he was not really talking to me, was super afraid to go out. He was speaking about going back to Ivory Coast&#8230;it was super, super hard for him. So, yeah, I would say two, two or three months of progression. And then, it was, three days of shooting.</p>



<p>N: Are you still speaking to Mamadou? Are you still in contact?</p>



<p>L: Yeah! We still talk to each other&#8230; on my phone sometimes I call him and stuff, but it&#8217;s difficult right now because everything is closed in France, so we have nowhere to meet. We had to talk a lot before the film, to get him comfortable and confident because it was a big film set. I wanted him to forget the camera.</p>



<p>N: Well congratulations it really worked, I thought you would&#8217;ve spent a lot longer than you did shooting, for him to be that comfortable.</p>



<p>L: To create that we had to go to lots of places, maybe one hour in one place, then move on&#8230;. to give the impression that it was over a longer period. So if you look at the film there is many different scenes that are super short. There were many different settings to give the feel that it was a long time.</p>



<p> The last thing I just wanted to say with DJAO&#8230; it was just super important to involve Mamadou, we can&#8217;t do these kind of films without that. If you want people to be be intimate with you, if you want people to give you access to some places, if you want to be people to be comfortable with you and to make the film, you have to make them the centre of the creative process.</p>



<p>N: So were you incorporating his ideas and opinions throughout?</p>



<p>L: Exactly, from the beginning the contract was &#8220;WE are making a film together&#8221;. So it&#8217;s your film. I&#8217;m just putting it into my city, my point of view of you, but it&#8217;s yours, your film. I think it&#8217;s super important to do that because if I didn&#8217;t do that, it&#8217;s just one random guy filming another guy with my subjectivity. If you give them ownership, people will get more involved and give you access to their real life and won&#8217;t play a role. So now I&#8217;m just a tool, you know. I think it was important for this part of the creative process.</p>

<p>After completing a degree in Biomedicine at St. Georges University, Maia is now completing a masters in psychology at Nottingham. Known for her gifted piano playing, quick wit and extreme fear of cows, Our conversation with Maia ranged from entertaining insight into her hatred of maths, to discussion of factors people of colour are forced to consider when applying for roles in science.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns top-image-append-above-right bottom-image-append-above-right">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p><strong>N: </strong>Tell me about yourself</p>



<p><strong>M: </strong>Growing up I never thought I would be a scientist. I hate maths… absolutely hate it, but I always wanted to be a doctor which I didn’t think would involve much maths. So I did a degree in biomedical science and in my final year took a lot of psychology modules and really enjoyed them. Then I took a year out to work as a teaching assistant with children with autism and now I’m doing a masters in psychology, which I know&nbsp; doesn’t say much about who I am…but it’s what I’m interested in. I used to do a lot of music, but I don’t have the time to do much anymore which is kind of sad.</p>



<p><strong>N</strong>: Do you think the intensity of doing a Biomed degree meant that your music was pushed to one side?</p>



<p><strong>M: </strong>A little bit, while I was in London I was actually studying for my performance diploma in first year until it got too much. Now that I’m in Nottingham (studying her Masters) I don’t have access to a piano, and the practice rooms are closed because of Covid so it’s quite hard to play and to find a balance between work and music.</p>



<p><strong>N: </strong>Did you perform much… or were you more of a bedroom musician?</p>



<p><strong>M: </strong>Both! I used to perform in piano competitions up until last year. It taught me a lot, it was always just me and a bunch of really young piano machines who have been playing since they were three, but it was actually a lot of fun. I’ve been thinking recently about creativity and science. How do you bring your creative side over to science, which can be very controlled and restrictive? Is there room for self-expression in science?</p>

<p></p>
</div>
</div>



<p><strong>N: </strong>I think there’s a common misconception that science and creativity are two separate entities, and that scientists are generally not creative people. Being a scientist means that you constantly have to be creative… coming up with new ideas, new theories, new experiments.<strong> &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>M: </strong>I think a lot of it is perspective. When you do something creative, your perspective completely changes, which can have a knock-on effect on other aspects of your life. A lot of what I’ve done throughout my life comes from three things: academia, sport and music. I often think of the ways that music has influenced how I understand sport. Music and dance have definitely affected the way I row as it’s a very rhythmic activity, while ballet has affected my movement in sport and even my approach to science.</p>



<p><strong>N: </strong>I completely agree. Part of the problem seems to be a lack of understanding. Someone who isn’t a mathematician may find maths completely rigid and unmalleable, while I’ve heard of physicists describe an equation as “beautiful” or “elegant” (Maia begins to retch uncontrollably) which are adjectives you’d usually associate with art or music. ANYWAY, so what made you go on to choose psychology?</p>



<p><strong>M: </strong>I’ve always wanted to be a doctor, but when I did those psychology modules in my final year I can honestly say that I’ve never enjoyed learning as much as I did then. It didn’t feel like a chore, I was looking forward to revision… it was almost like a flow state, everything was just piecing together perfectly. I thought “I can understand this, I like this, this is probably what I’m meant to do” and not gonna lie, people (mostly men) seem to come to me for free therapy anyway, maybe I should get paid for it! I’m not completely sure what area I want to go into, but I’m angling towards clinical psychology, neuropsychology or forensic psychology.</p>



<p><strong>N: </strong>What does being a forensic psychologist actually entail?</p>



<p><strong>M: </strong>So forensic psychology would be working within the criminal justice system, working with prisoners or people in the community with records. You could be an expert witness in a court case, that sort of thing. To be honest its very complex and I’m not sure I completely understand it all! Essentially the common theme is crime.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large collapse-below-left"><img loading="lazy" width="711" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/maia2-1-711x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1514" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/maia2-1-711x1024.jpg 711w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/maia2-1-768x1106.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/maia2-1.jpg 854w" sizes="(max-width: 711px) 100vw, 711px" /></figure>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>Neuropsychology focuses on people with traumatic brain injuries, Parkinsons and sometimes learning disabilities and autism. You have to know everything, neuropsychology is a post-doc qualification, as with forensic. You first have to train as a clinical psychologist, it’s a long road.</p>



<p><strong>N: </strong>Do you know where you may want to apply to?</p>



<p><strong>M: </strong>I’ve been thinking of another city apart from London. I really love Manchester, I considered Cambridge but then thought “do I really want to be at a place where someone’s trying to arrest me just for walking into the psychology building?!”. That sounds crazy but it literally happens to professors, I just think that’s another level which I’m not sure I’m ready for.</p>



<p><strong>N: </strong>So when considering what to do in your career (where to go, what to do), do you think your race can be a deciding factor?</p>
</div>
</div>



<p><strong>M: </strong>Yes definitely. I know that sometimes you just have to think “fuck this” and go anyway, but some of the experiences that I, and other people have had in academia have made me think it’s just not worth choosing certain places just because of their credentials. Three years is a long time, and an education is a holistic experience, if one aspect of that isn’t brilliant&#8230;. do I want to be there? If no one can really relate to your life experience, how are you really going to connect with anyone there?</p>



<p>It’s heart-breaking because it means there are all these missed opportunities and it’s not something other people would ever have to think about. The other side of the coin is then being offered opportunities because you are black. All these job descriptions that say “we especially encourage you to apply if you are black” and my parents saying “with the recent protests and the death of George Floyd, you’ll probably be straight in there!”. I don’t want to be a statistic, I want to be hired because you like me and my unique perspective, not just to fulfill your diversity quota. Plus, just hiring black people doesn’t mean your getting rid of racism in your workplace, its still there.</p>



<p><strong>N: </strong>Could you not argue that having positive discrimination and affirmative action is a necessary steppingstone to level-out the playing field?</p>



<p><strong>M: </strong>That’s also true, I think the work doesn’t stop with just hiring people. You have to continue to actively combat the stereotypes that are within everyone and the workplace.It’s something that I think about a lot, especially when considering my thesis this year. I really need quantitative experimental experience as my undergrad project was literature-based, so I need more experience with&#8230;(retches again)…numbers. I want to do something really scientific and experimental. But I then I feel I have a duty to do something meaningful in social psychology where I’m looking at race. So much of the literature within psychological science is about risk, negative things to do with black people involving racism and stereotypes.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns collapse-above-right">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>I just want to be able to be a black person, doing research about black people that isn’t negative. Of course all of it is incredibly important but having to constantly learn about only these things takes its toll. We have had lectures this year on prejudice and discrimination, I’m listening to a lecturer discuss a case study where white people were more likely to be saved from a fire, then its swiftly on to another horrific example of racism. This is my life, it’s me who is less likely to be saved from a burning building.</p>



<p>In psychology it seems that a lot of the clinical work is mainly done by white women, while the research is generally white men. I don’t know how I feel about that, do I think I can fit in these practices or institutions? One of my black friends who also did psychology at university opted out of continuing, even though she was the perfect candidate. When I asked her why she didn’t carry on, she said it was because the field was “too white” …. and now she’s doing something in HR. It hurts that she felt like she couldn’t go on, even though she’s incredibly gifted.</p>

<p><em>Diversity in psychology is a long-acknowledged issue, with cultural differences between doctor and patient preventing a true understanding of a person’s individual issues and needs. Research by the Health and Social Care Information centre&nbsp; showed that people from minority groups make up 9.6 % of qualified clinical psychologists. When considering that BAME individuals make up 13 % of the national population(ONS 2018), the urgent need for increased representation is ever more apparent</em></p>

<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p><strong>N:</strong> How would you describe your work in chemistry, to an uneducated fool such as myself?</p>



<p><strong>K:</strong> Up until recently my role was an analytical chemist and toxicologist. Making up dilutions and finding unknown compounds in samples. In the past I’ve worked in environmental settings and more recently in drug analysis, where I’ve tried to analyse drugs in biological samples such as urine and blood. That was all until April, from then onwards I’ve been working as a freelance illustrator and digital artist.</p>



<p><strong>N: </strong>Out of interest, what is the most interesting sample you have ever worked on when doing drug analysis?</p>



<p><strong>K:</strong> None in that role actually. I guess I’ve found a lot of weirdly coloured samples especially with the urine, that makes you question whether it’s even come from a human. Some people need to drink more water…</p>

</div>
</div>



<p><strong>N:</strong> Have you ever analysed a sample sent from a business and thought ‘This person is about to lose their job’ considering what you’ve found?</p>



<p><strong>K:</strong> I probably haven’t verbalised it in the lab, but I sometimes wonder how much this person must have ingested. Particularly with fat-soluble drugs such as marijuana which can take up to maybe three or four months to entirely clear from your system.</p>



<p>For one of my master’s projects, I was looking at how taking CBD products can result in a positive result in a drugs test. Obviously it depends on how much you take but there have been cases, so watch out!</p>



<p><strong>N:</strong> So do you think the next step for you is to do a PhD?</p>



<p><strong>K:</strong> It’s a bit weird.. I think I’m lowkey bonded with academia and that every time I feel I’m done with education and university I always end up coming back. I’ve always joked with my friends that I’ll never get a “real job” and will stay on to become a lecturer…professor… but I still want to explore my artistic side and spend some time on that.</p>



<p><strong>N: </strong>From my point of view Coventry and Kings seem quite different in terms of diversity, both in the students and lecturers, what was your experience of that?</p>



<p><strong>K: </strong>I found that there was more diversity with students at Coventry than in Kings, which is really bizarre when you think about it because I feel London is a very diverse city in general. There were some black and Asian lecturers I noticed in other science departments in Coventry, but not many in my one. In comparison at Kings, I did not see much diversity, in my campus at least.</p>

<div class="wp-block-column">
<p><strong>N: </strong>If prompted do you think you would be able to name two black Professors who taught or interacted with you at Kings?</p>



<p><strong>K:</strong> Definitely not. I find it very shocking when people say they have had a black professor lecture them, as I think I’ve only seen one in my life and I only know one person who have had a black professor teach them consistently through their degree (neuroscience).</p>



<p><strong>N:</strong> Where do you think this happens, the cut-off point where many black and minority people fail to progress to higher levels of academia?</p>



<p><strong>K:</strong> I think that right off the jump there are fewer black people wanting to do STEM subjects, with many opting do go for subjects such as law or business. Then those who do chose to do a science subject will usually go for the biological sciences, with even fewer going for chemistry or physics.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>I think that there is this impression that black people do not do fundamental science… a lot 1st generation black British students will have parents wanting them to do subjects such as medicine or law.</p>



<p>When considering people progressing to professor-level I think it’s since the visibility just isn’t there. It’s harder for people of colour and especially black people to make it to that status. I’ve heard from Post-Docs and PhD students that the effort just is not made by Universities to get black people into these positions. Most of them stay on the same sort of level and are not able to progress or they’re treated with bias. These things will happen from school all the to Post-Doc.</p>



<p><strong>N:</strong> So there are just hurdles at every step of the way, which makes the final professorship so unattainable, that very few non-white people manage to get there.</p>



<p><strong>K: </strong>Exactly. Some people argue that science isn’t political. In my view most science objects are headed by white, cishet (cis-gender and heterosexual) men… how could it not be? It’s almost as if it’s like an exclusive club, and that exclusivity makes it much harder for people like us to reach the top.</p>



<p>Until that sort of system can be dismantled, or at least until there is some form of allyship to help people of colour to get to that level, there won’t be a change.</p>



<p><strong>N:</strong> I found it surprising that when comparing Universities and academia to the traditionally “Old Boys Club” professions of banking and law, there doesn’t seem to be many POC-aimed internships and drives to improve representation.</p>



<p><strong>K:</strong> I hear it, you’d definitely think that there would be some sort of effort made. With the resurgence of the BLM movements, these institutions were blagging “welcoming all kinds of students from all walks of life…” and it just doesn’t show in their statistics.</p>



<p>I think another factor in why black kids don’t want to go into these fields is who they have to look up to. When they think of biology, chemistry and physics they literally see old white guys in lab coats. Those are the only people they see in school; they don’t know about black people who are doing this right now, they don’t know about younger people like you and I doing science right now. The visibility isn’t there… I can see why people are being turned off.</p>



<p><strong>N: </strong>What kind of initiatives and ideas would you suggest to improve things?</p>



<p><b>K:</b> Well there has been an effort already. There’s an  <a href="https://www.acrcollective.com/projects" data-type="URL">Afro-Caribbean researchers collective</a> from people around the UK, and similar groups. But these are groups and collectives that we’ve had to create ourselves to see our own visibility; we have to be the change we want to see.</p>



<p>By forming these groups and trying to build connections with universities and going into schools we can definitely try to encourage black kids to see STEM as an option. That coupled with actually being able to see esteemed black scientists in the field, doing lectures and running workshops…hopefully we can see a change.</p>
