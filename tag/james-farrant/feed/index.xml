<p>There are security checks in every metro station, utilising x-ray scanners and metal detectors. It’s easy to feel aware of the police presence in much of the city. At times it feels like a glimpse into an Orwellian high-tech future, with the overbearing lights illuminating one’s darkest dystopian fears.</p>



<p>The feeling this presence creates is visceral. Our very experience of space intersecting with an understanding about its relationship to the forces of surveillance, and control.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="681" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/watchfulforce10-1024x681.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4455" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/watchfulforce10-1024x681.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/watchfulforce10-768x511.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/watchfulforce10-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/watchfulforce10-1320x878.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Part of this comes from preconceptions. China has been historically notorious for its role in surveillance, censorship and control of its population.</p>



<p>We might question the legitimacy of these reporting’s though, given the Chinese government clearly being seen as a rival to the West. But beyond being seen as an exaggeration, perhaps this is a case of hypocrisy? London is reportedly among the most surveilled cities on the planet&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-surveilled-cities-in-the-world-china-london-atlanta-2019-8">[1]</a>.</p>

<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>Through the past two decades there has been a lot of reporting on China’s state censorship of the news. This is a process that has evolved from once simple methods. When an unfavourable report would come on the BBC World Service, for example, the screen would temporarily switch off <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/chinese-censors-temporarily-black-cnn-417411/">[2]</a>.</p>



<p>Since those days, in 2010, both Google and YouTube Since those days, in 2010, both Google and YouTube were blocked, marking a key stage in the state’s censorship transition into the Internet age&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/10449139">[3]</a>. Since then, a far more complex system of online censorship has evolved, with the systematic burying, flagging and hiding of dissenting texts taking place – with more moderate dissent being allowed, effectively constructing an image of free speech&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/19/world/thousands-of-internal-documents-reveal-how-china-censored-its-internet-in-the-early-days-of-the-pandemic.html">[4]</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>In recent years, reports on the persecution of Uyghurs in Xinjiang have emerged, with thousands disappearing into re-education centres, supposedly in order to “learn Chinese values”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmId2ZP3h0c">[5]</a>.</p>



<p>The reality of the situation is incredibly obscured, though evidence of thousands being put to unpaid labour has been reported&nbsp;<a href="https://qz.com/1811305/nike-apple-linked-to-forced-uighur-labor-in-china-report-says/">[6]</a>, accusations of rape, torture and forced sterilisation have also emerged, alongside innumerable other rights abuses&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/4/uighur-tribunal-hears-evidence-of-alleged-china-abuses">[7]</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns collapse-below-left">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>Any Uyghur whose behaviour is seen as having anything to do with religious belief – books, beards&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/18/china-detains-uighurs-for-growing-beards-or-visiting-foreign-websites-leak-reveals">[8]</a>, even dresses deemed too long&nbsp;<a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3483812">[9]</a>&nbsp;– have been targeted, with thousands of families split apart in the process. Amounting to both cultural, and human genocide.</p>



<p>Xingjiang laid the groundwork for a system of rigorous surveillance that could be rolled out across the nation. CCTV cameras are ever present, lining every street.</p>



<p>Accompanied by police checkpoints on almost every corner, at which citizens are required to show ID and provide justification for their presence&nbsp;<a href="http://%5B10%5D/">[10]</a>.</p>



<p>An understanding of this context colours one’s navigation of other Chinese cities such as Shenzhen; the feeling that our actions and identity could be under constant surveillance. </p>

</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>The reality of course, is that perpetual manned surveillance is near impossible, and that such cities are not direct parallels to Xinjiang.</p>



<p class="collapse-below-left">Despite this, state rollout of surveillance across other major Chinese cities, demonstrates that the intention may remain on the horizon. Across the centre of the city of Shenzhen there is a heavy police presence, and police booths are ubiquitous.</p>



<p>Meanwhile metro stations each have their own officer, one’s bags must be scanned on entry to any and every metro station.</p>



<p>But this is only a small part of the larger picture. In contrast to the overt heavy-handed authoritarianism of a fascist state, surveillance, and thus control, are far more subtle here.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>Still, we only need to look around, to observe the high presence of CCTV, symbolising the fact that our actions may be monitored.</p>



<p>You might ask why surveillance matters? It matters because the standard for acceptable behaviour placed on citizens by an unjust state, can easily veer into that which confines the individual. Facilitating oppressive punishment for the breaking of the rules.</p>



<p>Tresspass, drug use and dissent, stand out as examples of where pervasive surveillance allows the force the state to easily come down on rule breakers. This cements the political order and punishes those marginalised by it: those living by a morality beyond that of the state, or committing petty crimes in order to survive under a system that threatens it.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="693" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Huaqing-Road-1-1024x693.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4865" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Huaqing-Road-1-1024x693.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Huaqing-Road-1-768x519.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Huaqing-Road-1-1536x1039.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Huaqing-Road-1-1320x893.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The feeling this surveillance creates is strangely unsettling, especially when contrasted against the high-tech beauty of parts of the city. Creating a dual feeling of comfort and discomfort at one’s environment in the knowledge that they may be being watched.</p>



<p>A position perhaps only afforded to those able to navigate these spaces with the detachment of a tourist, where real consequences for misbehaviour are a fraction of that for citizens.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="693" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cyberrennaisance-1024x693.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4860" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cyberrennaisance-1024x693.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cyberrennaisance-768x520.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cyberrennaisance-1536x1040.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cyberrennaisance-1320x894.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>As an observer, I felt almost above the surveillance present, yet simultaneously fearful of it, in a country where punishment is beyond disproportionate. Ultimately, Shenzhen, and many other cities across China (and even London), construct a model of the world in which our locations, actions, conversations may be constantly surveilled.</p>



<p>And yet, we are free to navigate the expanses of the city, demonstrating the failure for models of surveillance to fall into strict binary established between Orwell and Huxley.</p>



<p>Orwell’s imagining was of total surveillance, and immeasurable consequence for stepping out of the clear paths established by authority; Huxley’s was of a society dominated by coercion and misinformation. This is a space that begins to embody facets of both.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="693" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/work-1024x693.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4862" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/work-1024x693.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/work-768x519.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/work-1536x1039.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/work-1320x893.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>For one to step out of the defined routes, to trespass for example, could result in severe punishment. Yet most citizens live their lives in relative freedom, privy to the spoils of middle-class luxuries, drink and food. All the while ones life is underlined by strict state control of information.</p>



<p>The notion that surveillance is a Chinese thing alone is no longer true, as tech becomes more ubiquitous, and as power and wealth concentrates. The same patterns may be observed globally, with high tech surveillance providing an easy means for states to control their citizens.</p>



<p>Shenzhen, and at the extreme, the experience of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang, act as case studies for this intersection of modernity and control.</p>

<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>Within the vast, modern city of Shenzhen in China, Baishizhou sticks out like a sore thumb. As one moves into it, the meaning of the modern city is completely subverted.</p>



<p>From the uninhabited open expanse, into the tight, noisy, populated streets you are immediately brought into a space that feels like a genuine reflection of the inhabitants that reside within it.</p>



<p>Shenzhen is a city largely defined by those who possess ownership of it. The city is sharply demarcated by each construction firm and their own goals; from one block to another one finds oneself within vastly different meanings of what the city is.</p>



<p>In this, Baishizhou represents a counter narrative to the modernity the city prides itself on, and as a consequence, is under threat.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>Shenzhen is fascinating for this very reason; its rapid growth has resulted in its very streets becoming a case study in the evolutions of modern cities.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>Shenzhen originated as a small collection of fishing villages. During the city’s exponential boom in the ‘70s, the CCP brought the land from the fishermen; however, due to their homeownership, they held on to the rights to occupy the land. As a result, the fishermen were granted greater agency over their pockets of land within the city. As the city grew it enveloped these areas of land, and a stark contrast emerged between the spaces which were owned by massive national firms, and the collectivisation era properties, owned by comparatively small enterprises <sup><a href="https://www.chinafile.com/features/destruction-of-baishizhou">[1]</a></sup>.</p>



<p>These urban villages came to play a big role in the city’s tech boom, providing affordable housing for the city’s low-income workers, nearby to the factories that produce the goods that put Shenzhen on the map <sup><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-12-20/workers-flocking-to-china-s-silicon-valley-can-t-afford-to-buy-homes">[2]</a></sup>. In its prime, 150,000 people inhabited Baishizhou, the largest of these villages <sup><a href="https://en.jiemian.com/article/5492716.html">[3]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Recently however, Baishizhou, and the hundreds of other urban villages, have been under threat. Their numbers have been shrinking. Since 2005 the government has been closing down parts of Baishizhou <sup><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/20/world/asia/skyscrapers-rise-in-china-mark-the-fall-of-immigrant-enclaves.html">[4]</a></sup>, and in 2017 plans were announced for a redevelopment of the entire site <sup><a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/471/11/112058/pdf">[5]</a></sup>. In 2019 it was reported that its 150,000 residents had been asked to leave by September of that year <sup><a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3019506/migrant-workers-forced-out-one-shenzhens-last-urban-villages">[6]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Since my visit to Shenzhen in 2018, with mass evictions in 2019, the population of this village has shrunk considerably, with entire streets being closed off <sup><a href="https://shenzhennoted.com/2021/03/23/is-the-era-of-shenzhen-urban-villages-over/">[7]</a></sup>. It seems the fate of this space is sealed.</p>



<p>The conflict between these areas in the city manifests the moment and context from which they arise. People’s lives are subject to the overwhelming power of capitalism, and the city that it creates (china’s economic reforms are expressly capitalist, with the majority of land and productive power being owned by private entities <sup><a href="https://thediplomat.com/2017/10/xi-jinping-thought-vs-deng-xiaoping-theory/">[8]</a></sup>).</p>



<p>These urban villages came about as marginalised spaces within a wider vision for a modern, construction firm led cityscape. For a period of time, they were able to exist for their usefulness in facilitating the city’s economic boom in the new technological era, providing affordable homes for migrant workers coming from the country’s rural areas in search of work.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p> </p>



<p>The quasi-organic form these spaces took formed a powerful counter narrative to the premeditated city, which surrounds it. Densely populated and full of life, they sit in stark contrast with the atomised navigation of space that takes place in the rest of the city.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="669" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/07/5KEDIT-1024x669.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3934" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/07/5KEDIT-1024x669.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/07/5KEDIT-768x502.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/07/5KEDIT-1536x1004.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/07/5KEDIT-1320x863.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>For the construction firms of the city, these plots of land represent massive financial incentive and opportunity. With property prices being exponentially high within the city, the potential profits of a redevelopment project are huge <sup><a href="https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/2023255/last-days-shenzhens-great-urban-village">[9]</a></sup>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>And with no one in power to defend the interests of these residents, they are forced out into the surrounding province of Guangdong. It seems that the convenience of these places of living was considered too high for the low-income residents of the village, amongst the wealthy megacity.</p>



<p>Ultimately, Baishizhou only existed, as a fragment of the cities disjointed metamorphosis: from a small fishing village of just 30,000 to a megacity of 12.59 million in just 40 years <sup><a href="https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/2023255/last-days-shenzhens-great-urban-village">[9]<sup></sup></a><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-12-20/workers-flocking-to-china-s-silicon-valley-can-t-afford-to-buy-homes#:~:text=In%202018%2C%20the%20Shenzhen%20government,both%20for%20sale%20and%20rent.&amp;text=Authorities%20have%20also%20been%20experimenting,free%20apartments%20to%20skilled%20workers.">[10]</a></sup> &#8211; a process of growth leading to the end point of a total hegemony of space, and marginalisation of the working poor.</p>



<p>This process highlights fundamental dynamics in Chinese capitalism. China has been moving rapidly from a production oriented LEDC, to finance and business oriented MEDC, with a massively expanding middle class.</p>

<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>As such, less need for low paid workers has led to the further marginalisation of the working class. Despite this, Chinas economy still has a massive reliance on its productive capacity, and the inevitable move to the homogenous form of the city, causes direct harm to the companies that have defined the city’s tech boom <sup><a href="https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/2023255/last-days-shenzhens-great-urban-village">[9]</a></sup>.</p>



<p>“If Shenzhen loses its affordable housing, the whole chain will break. The industrial sector will hollow out, and for most of our start-ups, our design companies, and our tech companies, the cost of labour will go up, because almost all of their young workers live in the urban villages.” – Local Architect; Duan Peng (SCMP, 2016)<sup><a href="https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/2023255/last-days-shenzhens-great-urban-village">[9]</a></sup></p>



<p>With less housing for low paid workers, these companies face a shortage of employees. Here we can see how the state steps in to resolve the inherent flaws that arise from unregulated capitalism. In 2018 the CCP announced its solution; by 2035, 60% of its new housing supply would be government-subsidized. Currently, state-backed homes account for just 5% of the market <sup>[10]</sup>.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>Ultimately, these urban villages represent clearly how space, and the life that inhabit it, relate to forces beyond their control. It demonstrates a microcosm of the flux of life within cities; as people seek out work and a means to a good life, alongside the conflicts this gives rise to.</p>

<p>On the 16th March, the British parliament passed the “Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill”, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/mar/16/bill-that-curtails-ability-to-protest-in-uk-passes-its-second-reading">with 359 votes for, to 225 votes against</a>. Alongside <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/travellers-could-imprisoned-setting-up-20190702">brutal further oppression of traveller communities</a>, the bill further enshrines the criminalisation of protest.</p>



<p>The law is intentionally vague, allowing very loose, case-by-case interpretation by the government and police. The bill permits police crackdown on any protest for causing <a href="https://www.bigissue.com/latest/social-activism/how-priti-patels-new-policing-bill-threatens-your-right-to-protest/">“serious annoyance, inconvenience or loss of amenity”</a> to the surrounding community, organisations and businesses. Any individual deemed as being responsible &#8211; likely organizers, though definitions of responsibility could apply to participants, could face a jail sentence of up to 10 years.</p>



<p>The bill also scraps legislation that caps sentencing at three months for damage of less than £5000, <a href="https://www.thejusticegap.com/assault-on-our-rights-new-justice-bill-threatens-clampdown-on-protest-and-runaway-sentence-inflation/">increasing it to a max of 10 years</a>. Allowing for the harsh sentencing of anyone who might damage a statue, smash the window of a bank etc.</p>



<p>Justice Secretary Robert Buckland QC <a href="https://insidetime.org/no-one-will-serve-10-years-for-damaging-statues-government-admits/">told the Commons</a> it “ensures our courts have sufficient sentencing powers to punish the <em>emotional harm</em> caused by this type of offending”.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>This is one of the most authoritarian moves we have seen in Britain in decades, and within the wider context of conservative legislation, poses a fundamental threat to democracy, freedom. And it must be opposed.</p>



<p>So why is it that this bill has been put into motion? What is it about protests that the conservatives feel compelled to stop?</p>



<p>This bill appears to be crafted in direct response to the two major protest movements that have taken place in recent years – Black Lives Matter, and Extinction Rebellion. These protests were both disruptive, wide spread and massively influential in their own right, and so, were regarded by home secretary Priti Patel as extreme annoyances, going so far as to paint the more radical individuals participating in protest as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/jun/08/you-will-face-justice-priti-patel-condemns-minority-of-thugs-at-uk-anti-racism-protests-video">thugs</a>, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/08/extinction-rebellion-criminals-threaten-uks-way-of-life-says-priti-patel">criminals</a>…</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="679" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/crop3-679x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2450" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/crop3-679x1024.jpg 679w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/crop3-768x1157.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/crop3-1019x1536.jpg 1019w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/crop3-1320x1989.jpg 1320w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/crop3.jpg 1351w" sizes="(max-width: 679px) 100vw, 679px" /></figure>
</div>
</div>



<p>And so, the threat the Conservatives feel these movements pose legitimises their intention of legislating future protest out of existence. This move to pass this bill comes at a time, where institutionally, the left is incredibly weakened.</p>



<p>Labour under Keir Starmer is in complete disrepair, with a leader who is more intent on appealing to an imagined middle England, than actually standing up for what’s right.</p>



<p>The right largely dominates the media, with most mainstream voices failing to hold the government to account, stand up for marginalised groups, and question the status quo.</p>



<p>Much of the BBC plays into the hands of the conservatives (in particular News Broadcasts and Radio 4). Discussions are framed by whichever guests are brought on, with economic ideas generally being set only as left as centrism. Further, the “UK’s leading journalists” seem generally confused, as to whether their role is to act as government broadcaster, or, to hold power to account.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="684" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horsies4-1024x684.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2458" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horsies4-1024x684.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horsies4-768x513.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horsies4-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horsies4-1320x881.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>A clear example of this come through in their publishing of what is, effectively propaganda, in the form of<a href="https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1367089120267407363"> pro Rishi Sunak reports</a>. Though they manifest in far more subtle ways&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;A <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/our_work/breadth_opinion/content_analysis.pdf">study</a> carried out by researchers at Cardiff University, who analysed BBC news coverage from 2007 and 2012, concluded that conservative opinions received more airtime than progressive ones. However, those findings contradict a 2013 <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cps.org.uk/files/reports/original/130814102945-BBCBiasOliverLathamfc.pdf">report</a> by the Centre for Policy Studies think tank which claimed that the corporation is biased towards the left.&#8221; (<a href="https://www.theweek.co.uk/100501/is-the-bbc-biased">The Week</a>) &#8211; The Centre for policy studies was <a href="https://www.cps.org.uk/about/">founded by Margaret Thatcher</a> (more resources on media bias here: <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1464884916648094">[4]</a> <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2019/12/bbc-media-bias-boris-johnson-uk">[5]</a>).</p>



<p>Further moves to co-opt the media are evident in the imposition of <a href="https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/read-this/new-bbc-chairman-richard-sharp-has-donated-ps400k-conservative-party-2001-3088420">a tory donor as the chairman of the BBC</a>, and the <a href="https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2021/02/01/paul-dacre-set-to-be-announced-as-ofcom-chair/">former chief Daily Mail editor as the head of OFCOM</a> (Communications Regulator) setting the stage for a fundamentally different UK television broadcast landscape, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/16/world/europe/murdoch-uk-news-channel.html">the start of GB News</a>, parroting Fox news, where – reality is irrelevant. Any further shift to the right of the BBC would appear sane in comparison.</p>



<p>The Tories have also set their sights on universities, imposing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/14/government-to-appoint-free-speech-champion-for-universities-heritage-history-cancel-culture">“free speech champions”</a> off the back of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/05/boris-tatchell-greer-were-they-actually-no-platformed">misrepresentations of “de-platorming”</a>, and complaints from a conservative students with severe victim complexes. A move which increases pressure on universities, out of fear for their position as left wing spaces.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, through avenues of grassroots movements, culture, social media, and mass protest – the Conservatives have been posed with a threat, realms in which influence and control are resisted.</p>

<p>Nothing infuriates them more than the discussion, exchange, proliferation of ideas, and protest in response to injustices. Spaces through which we are able to break through the narratives of the media, bringing topics into the mainstream and challenging power. Without them, the scope of ideas and representation in the public realm would be greatly limited. And thus, are crucial to a functioning democracy.</p>



<p>It’s almost humorous, that at the same time this bill was passed, the secretary of state <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-56423716">stated that democracy globally is under retreat</a>, and that the UK government must play its role in furthering it globally. Since the 2019 protests the government has engaged in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/01/seven-former-foreign-secretaries-urge-uk-to-take-lead-on-hong-kong">numerous discussions over concerns for the liberties of the Hong Kong people</a>, under the tyranny of the Chinese government.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>During the peak of the Hong Kong protests, protestors attending unpermitted protests could be subject to a <a href="https://www.hklii.hk/en/legis/ord/245/s18">maximum penalty of 5 years</a>, a policy not a million miles from the level of criminalisation found in our own policing bill.</p>



<p>There is beauty in the resistance of protests. The power of standing in a crowd of people who share your concerns, and dreams; creating a space in which, we temporarily break from the narratives we live under.</p>



<p>Making your voice heard, and pushing to assert positive change is powerful. And represents one of the few realms we have to politically engage and affect change, in a system where real democracy remains elusive.</p>

<div class="subhead">ON BRISTOL</div>



<p>Since writing this article, the Kill the Bill protest in Bristol, and the &#8220;violence&#8221; thereof, has become the defining moment for the broader resistance to this bill, receiving far more mainstream coverage than the bill itself ever had. Though accusations of violence are shaky at this point, given the Bristol Police having <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/bristol-police-broken-bones-kill-bill-protests_uk_605c5d00c5b6531eed021915">lied about broken bones and a punctured lung</a>.</p>



<p>While I do not condone the use of “violence” in this context, I certainly do not think we should outright condemn it. Nor should we let it distract us from the context within which it arose.</p>



<p>Ultimately, violence is a product of anger, and anger is a legitimate response to the state of this country, especially from those who are most on the receiving end. The violence of the British state is immense and multifaceted, in its <a href="https://greenworld.org.uk/article/uk-immigration-detention-centres-dehumanising-and-traumatic">treatment of refugees</a>, traveller communities, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/stop-search-disparity-compounds-distrust-5206638">poor black communities</a>, and so on&#8230;</p>



<p>While this violence may not be tactical, and it would be preferable for it not to have happened, we should not allow it to divide us.</p>



<p>The labour opposition to this bill was tenuous, and would have amounted to moderate revisions to the bill at best. But it remains true that public consensus behind movements for them to be effectual is a need (though not a metric for morality). In this context, perceptions of violence may turn away some individuals who are sympathetic. Gauging a public mood in this moment though is difficult, especially with of a large demographic of disillusioned people.</p>



<p>Despite what has happened, the way forward continues in grassroots movements in response to the government. Direct action, community organising, strikes, social media campaigns, flyposting and protesting. The bill has been delayed until &#8220;later this year&#8221;, a move which we cannot allow to diffuse the momentum and resistance against it.</p>

<p>Was one of the defining tactics of the protestors who transformed the city of Hong Kong throughout 2019. The 15th of September was no exception to this. Despite permission being withdrawn by the police, the unrelenting nature of the movement again made itself apparent. Standing at the entrance to Causeway Bay metro station you see a sea of masked faces already gathered, and hundreds more still continuing to appear, seemingly from thin air. The same normally unremarkable passengers who ride the metro with you, begin donning the attire synonymous with the protests.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="705" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dm-1-705x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-148" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dm-1-705x1024.jpg 705w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dm-1-207x300.jpg 207w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dm-1-768x1115.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dm-1-1058x1536.jpg 1058w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dm-1-1411x2048.jpg 1411w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dm-1-scaled.jpg 1763w" sizes="(max-width: 705px) 100vw, 705px" /></figure>



<p>Here you begin to see the dividing line between those who identify themselves as “Wo Lei Fei” (和理非), the non-violent protesters dressed more casually for the occasion. And the “Yung Mo” (勇武) or “Valiant”. Those who come well prepared for the inevitable confrontations, more often dressed in black, and carrying protective gear. Despite the distinctions however, there is one thing they all have in common, face masks. Staring into the crowds, they’re almost universal.</p>
</div>

<div class="wp-container-62114474c6fda wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<p>Something which reflects the unified nature of the city’s protestors, despite coming from such varied backgrounds, they all know they must stick together if they are to have any chance of changing the course of the city’s future for the better, to shift the balance of power away from Beijing, and toward democracy. The decision to wear a mask makes a lot of sense, when you consider the maximum penalty for illegal assembly in the city is 5 years in prison. And at just 30km away from Shenzhen, a global technology capital, awareness of the power of surveillance technology in the city is key to ones self-preservation.</p>



<p>This isn’t the only place where technology comes into play in the streets. If the crowds are to have a chance with their rallies and actions, they need to be able to move through the city, making as much of a visible impact as possible whilst still evading the tight restrictions and heavy force placed on them by the police.</p>



<p>For example, despite the protest being supposedly cancelled by its organisers, the directly democratic means that can be found online, in places such as the LIHKG forum or on the encrypted messaging apps such as Telegram, mean that calls can be put out just hours before the rally, and still be heeded by 10s of thousands. Some of which perhaps may even have been encouraged to attend by the more trivial methods such as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hong-kong-youth-using-tinder-and-pokemon-go-organize-protests-2019-8?r=US&amp;IR=T" data-type="URL">tinder or even Pokémon Go</a>,  showing just how pervasive the movement had become. In fact, the very same month it was reported that around 70% of the city were in support of the protests. Something, which as the crowds had formed and begun to march, was not hard to believe, looking out over the sea of umbrellas.</p>
