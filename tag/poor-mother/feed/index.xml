<p>Psychosomatic Swimtrospection is the psychological space that is created when one goes swimming in a public swimming pool. It is an oxymoronic state, where both external and internal are mixed to create a new, exposed physicality. Exposure is a key component within Psychosomatic Swimtrospection as it occurs throughout, most visually in the initial swimming uniform. Much of the subject’s body is left uncovered from the point of exiting the changing room, inducing a sense of intimate viewership, but denying that viewership access to the personal through swimming caps or goggles. Bodily awareness is heightened, in a similar social sense to John Berger’s idea of the third person perspective in ‘Ways of Seeing’:</p>



<p>‘Men act and women appear. Men look at women, women watch themselves being looked at’.</p>



<p>This combination of anonymity and exposure actively encourages introspection through directing the subject’s gaze inward, in turn creating more emotional exposure as the subject is confronted with the self. At its essence, physical exposure induces emotional exposure.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large widtheighty"><img width="1024" height="534" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/luceillu1-1024x534.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1862" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/luceillu1-1024x534.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/luceillu1-768x400.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/luceillu1.jpg 1189w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>This is further reinforced in the act of swimming and the blurring of surface and subconscious. Above the surface, time passes normally and sensory overload indicates an overwhelming presence of reality. The subject is alerted to bodily sensation and is constantly aware of their own physicality. Below the surface, reality is disconnected and replaced with escapism. As the water pressure pushes in, so do thoughts and perception. It’s not about looking outward but inward. Through swimming, the subject repeatedly flips between these two states, creating a duality of external and internal, emotional and physical.</p>



<p>All objects of the swimming pool contribute towards this in their own ways.</p>



<p>The lifeguard, for example, continues the theme of observation to a voyeuristic effect as their gaze is usually constant, but impersonal. They therefore act as conceptual representation of the act of looking rather than direct attention.</p>



<p>The filtration grates, in particular, emphasise the same oxymoronic duality present in consideration of external and internal. Their primary function is to filter away human waste – be it urine, plasters, hair or bits of float. Although they are collecting unclean elements, in doing so they are keeping the pool clean. Their purpose is therefore split, as they have to contain two contrasting states – clean and dirty.</p>



<p>The item I have found most interesting is the towel, which resembles identity and memory of self, abandoned to one side but emotionally tied to the subject. When the subject exits the pool, their thoughts and feelings are consolidated in the wrapping of a towel – a physical reminder of outside identity layered on top of whatever state the subject leaves the pool in.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large widtheighty"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="486" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/luceillu2-1024x486.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1865" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/luceillu2-1024x486.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/luceillu2-768x365.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/luceillu2.jpg 1268w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Since coining Psychosomatic Swimtrospection, I have attempted its representation in various forms, using it as a tool to expose and confront my personal self. For me, the introspection of swimming pools closely coincides with my own disability and sexuality. After finding these common qualities, I researched the associations between mental illness and low libido in queer young people, documenting their stories in a short film ‘LIBIDON’T’ for the Live Art Development Agency: (<a href="https://vimeo.com/514210218">https://vimeo.com/514210218</a>).</p>



<p>Having a decreased sex drive as a result of severe mental illness or medication is a very common but vastly underrepresented difficulty. In my own experience, it exists in the same duality of surface as swimming pools in its external and internal exposure.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large widtheighty"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="599" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/luceillu3-1024x599.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1866" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/luceillu3-1024x599.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/luceillu3-768x449.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/luceillu3.jpg 1307w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>I began some representation of my own exposure in print-making, as I was interested in condensing my use of abstract narrative language alongside image. The prints work as a series, detailing the grosser aspects of bulimia through the repeated image of a pool filtration grate. Visually, the large areas of shadow consume the lighter parts and figure in ambiguous dread, weaving through the work like the words that accompany them. They speak of a consistent evaluation of self and yearning to be better through physical discharge and expulsion of unwanted parts, both physical and emotional.</p>



<p>These prints have been cathartic in my recent movement towards making more personal work, and in combining the visual and text-based elements of my practice. In their conception, and in creating Psychosomatic Swimtrospection, I have formed a language of exposure – a dialectical approach to the recurring thoughts and patterns that control my life. In this process of art-making, I lay bare my essence.</p>
