<p>My social media feed has been dominated by videos from Gaza of babies blown limb from limb, whole families wiped out by a single missile and entire media buildings being destroyed. Without the bravery of Palestinians who have opted to risk death in order to go outside and film these scenes to show the world their pain, we would be blind to the atrocities of the Israeli State.</p>

<p>As a result, I have felt compelled to write this article in which I hope to exemplify the similarities between the most evil state in European History, with the very country that was created in response to its atrocities. Before starting I would like to say that this is by no means targeting Jewish people, but instead the Zionist project and Netanyahu’s current far-right Israeli regime, whose methods of indoctrination, control and brutalisation echo the tragedies of history. It is also not the first and I am sure it will not be the last country to create such discriminatory laws (the British Empire did this many times and were an integral part of the Zionist project in Palestine).</p>



<p>I write this without prejudice; I am not Jewish or Muslim, Palestinian or Israeli but instead a fair-minded observer of the facts and, in my opinion, the similarities between the techniques and strategies of the two oppressive regimes stand out to me astonishingly. Thus, I will do this by first examining the incredibly successful propaganda machines of both countries; secondly the tactics of dehumanisation and justifications both regimes have used for their targeted ethnic groups; and finally the ways in which this led to the ethnic cleansing in their respective countries.</p>



<p>The UN General Assembly of 1975 determined zionism to be “a form of racism and racial discrimination.” Yet the strength of the Israeli propaganda machine indoctrinates many, not only in Israel, but especially in places such as the USA, with the Zionist ideals of a commitment to the unquestioning defence of Israel and a deep entitlement to the Palestinian homeland despite their origins as white Europeans. Not only do they propagate pro-Israeli propaganda but also an anti-Arab message that promotes discrimination and apartheid.&nbsp; In January 2020, the Israeli Ministry of Strategic Affairs donated $40,000 to the American anti-Muslim hate group <em>Proclaiming Justice to the Nations.</em> Palestinians have been evicted, tortured, brutalised, exiled and dehumanised yet through Israel’s worldwide propaganda, and huge lobbying of foreign governments, they have successfully remained the victim in the media’s eyes.</p>



<p>Comparably, Nazi propaganda put all Germans in an awkward position – the idea being that if you loved the motherland then you hated the Jews. They utilised Joseph Goebbels’ propaganda machine to indoctrinate millions of people into supporting the Nazi party through starting from an early age at the Hitler youth camps, strict censorship and consistent messages of racial superiority. Although the Nazi’s efforts were far more virulent there are obvious similarities between the two which are both, after all, far-right regimes.</p>



<p>Zionist philosophies are ingrained from a young age through biased education, and then reinforced with every Israeli citizens’ requirements to do three years of military service where a nationalist ideology is instilled in order to protect from the ‘other.’ The Israeli Military Censor will then censor any material that threatens the security of Israel, thereby, any publications coming from Palestinian land protesting their unfair treatment. Just as the Nazis hid their treatment of Jews from their citizens and the world, Israel has been hiding the brutalising of Palestinians successfully for decades however it is threatened by the advent of social media. It is for this reason Palestinian media, electricity and internet has been a major target.</p>

<p>When footage of Palestinians being killed is inevitably shared with the world, Israeli-backed propaganda is quick to point the finger at Palestinian aggression. Hamas is often the main subject of contention as it has been labelled a terrorist organisation by many western governments, and their rocket fire has been used to justify the senseless killing of thousands of innocent palestinian men, women and children. The reality of this situation however is more nuanced than the medias representation, palestinians have been subject to extraordinary levels of brutality since 1948.</p>



<p>And with the overwhelming military force placed on them by the israeli military, an armed response is to be expected, as dissilusioned palestinians chose to fight for their freedoms. Hamas fail to differentiate between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism in their covenants and have resorted to suicide attacks, yet their designation as a terrorist group is arguable as their attacks target civilians no more than Israeli attacks do. Of course, their militant rule is by no means benign however it is a well known fact that extremism is a result of poverty thus Israel’s blockade of Gaza is directly responsible for Hamas’ inception.</p>



<p>Western governments and media sit on the fence as to who is to blame because Israel provides a lot of trade (Biden has agreed a $735m sale of weapons this May and the UK’s exports of arms have reached record levels) despite the fact that twenty times more Palestinians are killed than Israelis. Not only does this exemplify why western governments are unwilling to condemn the actions of Israel no matter how gruesome, but also the enormous repertoire of weapons that Israel is arming itself with to fight the blockaded, poverty-stricken people of Gaza.</p>



<p>One way the Nazis justified their actions towards Jews was to dehumanise them so their maltreatment would not be so offensive. The 1935 Nuremberg Laws designated Jews as second-class citizens because of their ‘impure blood.’ It was a way of persuading the German population that their actions were reasonable and justified because they were an inferior people to Aryan Germans. Through repetition, indoctrination and propaganda the German people were brainwashed into believing these bogus notions to such an extent that many worked at the Jewish death camps overseeing the deaths of millions of people. To dehumanise someone is to ignore their humanity and once that can be achieved on a widespread scale the systematic cleansing of people becomes justifiable, and thereby, accepted.</p>



<p>Netanyahu’s regime has achieved this in the eyes of many Israelis, especially their military. Palestinians are dehumanised in the media and at the highest roles in government in order to facilitate the continued evictions and widespread brutaliastion of Palestinian people. Here are a selection of quotes from some high ranking ministers in the Israeli government:</p>



<p>“Beat them up, not once but repeatedly, beat them up so it hurts so badly, until it’s unbearable.” &#8211; Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli Prime Minister, 2001</p>



<p>[The Palestinians] are like animals, they aren’t human. A Jew always has a much higher soul than a gentile.” Eli Ben-Dahan, Former Deputy Minister of Defence, 2013</p>



<p>“I’ve killed many Arabs in my life, and there’s no problem with that.” &#8211; Naftali Bennett, Former Member of Knesset, 2013</p>



<p>“They are all enemy combatants, and their blood shall be on their heads, they should go, as should the physical homes in which they raised the snakes, otherwise more little snakes will be raised there.” &#8211; Ayelet Shaked, Former Justice Minister, 2014</p>

<p>Dehumanisation has been a strategy used by the oppressor for centuries through a mix of bogus eugenics, propaganda, philosophy and rewritten histories. Catholics were dehumanised by the British in Britain and Ireland; African people were dehumanised for centuries by white Europeans as a way to justify their enslavement and, of course, Jews have been dehumanised throughout history, but most notably during Nazi rule. Current Israeli tactics are nothing new but, I have used this comparison because the Holocaust has been used by defenders of the Israeli regime as a way to justify their acts of terror through a god-given right to that land. It has even been used as an excuse for revenge:</p>



<p>In 2015 at the Zionist Congress Netanyahu made the accusation that the Palestinian Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, was responsible for the Holocaust because he told Hitler to burn the Jews instead of expelling them to Israel which is a pure falsehood. Netanyahu not only stooped to the depths of lying during his speech but he also exonerated the Nazis of coming up with the Holocaust. His hatred for the Palestinian people is so great that he is willing to absolve Hitler of full responsibility in order to increase the support for a continuation of attacks on the Palestinians out of a bloodlust for revenge. This is the reason why I have compared the Israeli regime with the Nazi regime; one cannot and must not use their own persecution as a justification to persecute others.</p>



<p>During the ghettoisation of Jews throughout the German Empire houses were either labelled with the star of David, robbed or burnt to the ground and the people who lived or worked inside of these buildings were moved to unsanitary, overcrowded ghettos where many died of disease, starvation, and brutal maltreatment. This anti-semitism was as a result of Hitler using Jews as a scapegoat for losing the First World War. Their brutalisation was then justified through a systematic publication of propaganda that dehumanised and vilified Jews within the German Empire. Jews were rendered second or third class citizens. The propaganda mobilised the German population to accept and support the racially targeted persecution and mass murder of Jews. The long process of dehumanising a certain group in the eyes of the public prepares this public to accept the most brutal and criminal measures against them.</p>



<p>Now when we talk about Israel, its inception and its propaganda campaigns it is hard to avoid the shocking similarities that surface. The Palestinians have been treated as second or third class citizens as well since the early creation of Israel by war in 1948. During that war around 700,000 Palestinians were forced by armed Zionist organisations from their homes and expelled from their own country as Israel took control of the UN-sanctioned Palestinian territories. Those who did not leave the country were given Arab Israeli citizenship which, in theory, gave them equal rights to Israelis. Those who remained in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza were subject to life under an occupying power. These Palestinians are technically stateless and so cannot vote, gain passports (thereby leave or return) are subject to constant searches and roadblocks and those in Gaza are threatened by indiscriminate bombing and an illegal blockade.</p>

<p>Since 1948 the Israeli people have been aggressively grabbing Palestinian land properties within the newly established state. After the second war in 1967 the same policy of stealing the land intensified in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem in violation of international law. This is undertaken as a result of Zionist principles that is simply cloaked settler colonialism. As more Palestinian land is expropriated, more Palestinian inhabitants are thereby forced into fleeing to refugee camps in the surrounding countries or into the Gaza Strip. Just as Germans who benefitted from the forceful evictions of Jews were comforted by the blanket of being part of the superior Aryan race, Israelis who benefit from the forceful evictions of Palestinians are comforted by the blanket of Zionism and its doctrine.</p>



<p>This is why the Gaza Strip, which is 200㎢ smaller than the Isle of Man has a population that is 25 times larger than it at over two million. The blockade, imposed since 2007, around the territory has repeatedly stopped construction materials and fuel from entering, cut off all electricity, restricted food and water, medical assistance, and COVID vaccines, all the while preventing Palestinians from leaving. The UN declared that the Strip is ‘unlivable’ because of the worsening conditions of all aspects of human life. It does not take someone with an anti-Israeli agenda to see the similarities of a ghettoised Jewish camp of 1940 to the entire Gaza Strip in 2021.</p>



<p>Palestinians are literally forced out of their homes and businesses in exactly the same way Jews were in the 1930s and 40s, and a police or army presence will always side with the Israeli aggressor giving the Arabs nowhere to turn. Yes, Israel are not shipping Palestinians to death camps but they are slowly cleansing the country of the Palestinian ‘threat.’ And it is at times of violence and uprising such as this when indiscrimate killing of Palestinian men, women and children become easier for the Israeli State to justify. They claim to be acting in defence (even when their bombs target schools and hospitals) so as to remain the victim in this so-called conflict. We in the West are only made aware of the Zionist killing machine when their slow and silent cleansing is intensified to war and bombs.</p>



<p>Of course, the Nazis committed far more atrocities and were responsible for the worst genoicde in human history, however I hope I have exemplified ways in which the Israeli far-right regime shares many similarities with that of the Nazis. They are steadily cleansing Palestinian territories of Palestinians, forcing them abroad or into the open air prison that is the Gaza Strip; they rely heavily on state funded anti-Muslim and pro-Zionist propaganda and they use bogus sceince and history to dehumanise Palestinians in order to justify their brutal acts.</p>

<p>I want to again reiterate that this is by no means intended to be anti-Jewish but instead a criticism of the Zionist project and the current Israeli regime. It is important that we are not silenced when talking about Israel and its crimes because of a fear of seeming anti-semitic. That is the most common refute to criticism of Israel and thus, derails the intended point of the conversation which, ultimately, is not a religious one at all, but a human one. It is a story of oppressor versus oppressed not of Jews versus Muslims and thus, it is vital that we stand with the Palestinians who are merely fighting for their most basic human rights.</p>



<p>“Every single member of my family on both sides were exterminated [in the Holocaust]… it is because of the lessons my parents taught me and my two siblings that I will not be silent when Israel commits its crimes against the Palestinians. I consider nothing more despicable than to use their suffering and their martyrdom to try to justify the torture, the brutalisation, the demolition of homes that Israel daily commits against the Palestinians. So I refuse any longer to be intimidated by the tears. If you had any heart in you, you would be crying for the Palestinians.”</p>



<p>-Norman Finkelstein, an American Jew speaking at the University of Waterloo, Canada.</p>
