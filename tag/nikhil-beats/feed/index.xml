<p>Nikhil Beats is an up-and-coming Artist and Producer from East London. Drawing from a wide variety of influences, Nikhil has crafted a unique, hard-to-pin-down sound which reflects the multi-cultural society he grew up in. Featuring on tracks which make it to the playlists of future-facing 1Xtra DJ <strong><em>Jamz Supernova</em></strong>, Nikhil has also recently released his first solo EP <strong><em>3000 Realms</em></strong> to critical acclaim.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nikhil:</span> I started making music when I was a kid, learnt the piano and then started writing songs when I was 12 or 13. Music is something I’ve always loved and always wanted to do, there’s never been anything else I wanted to do as much, although at one point I was contemplating studying Quantum Physics at Uni…but I’m happy I stuck with the music.</p>



<p>My influences growing up vary from loads of different places, just everything that was around me. Bollywood music has influenced me a lot, all the music that my parents would play.</p>

<p>My dad was really into Funk, House, Disco and Soul, my mum was into Jazz and Classical, while my older sister would play me Grime, Garage and old school R&amp;B.</p>



<p>When I made <strong><em>3000 Realms</em> </strong>I can’t say I really had a process, it was more or less just making some music. It was during lockdown and artists couldn’t meet and have sessions, so I thought I’d just make some music and make something that would stand on its own without other artists… it started off as just instrumental tracks. As things opened up I just started putting things together, it was quite natural and I didn’t really think too much about it. An idea would just come into my head and I’d act on it, <em>“Make a video” </em>so I’d make a video etc… next thing I know I’ve got two music videos and singles and it was a fully formed project. A lot of it is just not putting up mental blocks in your own head and allowing  the creativity to flow when you’re in that phase.</p>

<p>Music is more than a full time job, its more than enough to keep me busy and I do it for work and play. I’m a Buddhist and that takes up a lot of my time, I chant as part of my practice, go to meetings and readings. As I’m quite intense with my work, in my downtime I just like to sit with my people&#8230; hang-out or go for a bike ride, just chill with friends and family.</p>



<p>There’s this Japanese composer called <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jZNKV5ROBM">Joe Hisaishi</a></em>, he’s the guy who wrote the music for the Studio Ghibli film <em>Howls Moving Castle</em>. I think the music is so beautiful, completely out of my genre of but it would be mad work with him. In 5 years time I want my music to be global, I’d like my music to help me travel the world and work with international artists, just meeting and connecting with people.</p>
