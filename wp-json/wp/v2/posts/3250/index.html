Drawing from a wide variety of influences, Nikhil has crafted a unique, hard-to-pin-down sound which reflects the multi-cultural society he grew up in. Featuring on tracks which make it to the playlists of future-facing 1Xtra DJ <strong><em>Jamz Supernova<\/em><\/strong>, Nikhil has also recently released his first solo EP <strong><em>3000 Realms<\/em><\/strong> to critical acclaim.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Nikhil:<\/span> I started making music when I was a kid, learnt the piano and then started writing songs when I was 12 or 13. Music is something I\u2019ve always loved and always wanted to do, there\u2019s never been anything else I wanted to do as much, although at one point I was contemplating studying Quantum Physics at Uni\u2026but I\u2019m happy I stuck with the music.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My influences growing up vary from loads of different places, just everything that was around me. Bollywood music has influenced me a lot, all the music that my parents would play.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"748\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/nikhil-2-748x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3266\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/nikhil-2-748x1024.jpg 748w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/nikhil-2-768x1051.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/nikhil-2.jpg 957w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>My dad was really into Funk, House, Disco and Soul, my mum was into Jazz and Classical, while my older sister would play me Grime, Garage and old school R&amp;B.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I made <strong><em>3000 Realms<\/em> <\/strong>I can\u2019t say I really had a process, it was more or less just making some music. It was during lockdown and artists couldn\u2019t meet and have sessions, so I thought I\u2019d just make some music and make something that would stand on its own without other artists\u2026 it started off as just instrumental tracks. As things opened up I just started putting things together, it was quite natural and I didn\u2019t really think too much about it. An idea would just come into my head and I\u2019d act on it, <em>\u201cMake a video\u201d <\/em>so I\u2019d make a video etc\u2026 next thing I know I\u2019ve got two music videos and singles and it was a fully formed project. A lot of it is just not putting up mental blocks in your own head and allowing  the creativity to flow when you\u2019re in that phase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"694\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/nikhil-4-694x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3259\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/nikhil-4-694x1024.jpg 694w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/nikhil-4-768x1133.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/nikhil-4.jpg 969w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>Music is more than a full time job, its more than enough to keep me busy and I do it for work and play. I\u2019m a Buddhist and that takes up a lot of my time, I chant as part of my practice, go to meetings and readings. As I\u2019m quite intense with my work, in my downtime I just like to sit with my people&#8230; hang-out or go for a bike ride, just chill with friends and family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s this Japanese composer called <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0jZNKV5ROBM\">Joe Hisaishi<\/a><\/em>, he\u2019s the guy who wrote the music for the Studio Ghibli film <em>Howls Moving Castle<\/em>. I think the music is so beautiful, completely out of my genre of but it would be mad work with him. In 5 years time I want my music to be global, I\u2019d like my music to help me travel the world and work with international artists, just meeting and connecting with people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-audio\"><audio controls src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/3.-HONEY-ft.-Bawo-X-Ayeisha-Raquel-.mp3\"><\/audio><figcaption>Nikhil Beats &#8211; HONEY (feat.
