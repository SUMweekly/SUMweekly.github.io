This short piece was commissioned by the Roundhouse Theatre and is a time capsule made for a friend, Jordan, a 21-year-old male from South London at the beginning of his gender transitioning story. Her film is a soft and honest account of the experience of Jordan navigating transitioning in his hometown.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>P:<\/strong> My name\u2019s Phoebe, I\u2019m a filmmaker, but during COVID I\u2019m a motion graphic designer and work a bit on podcasts with visual design and branding. I\u2019ve been doing that for roughly a year based in South-east London.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s my first and only doc I\u2019ve done. We shot in December last year [2019], which feels like a long time ago.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>J:<\/strong> How was the filming process, did it run smoothly?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>P:<\/strong> It was a little hard actually, I didn&#8217;t know what to expect. But it was funded, and I had mentorship within the Roundhouse. I had a mentor called<strong> Nia Childs<\/strong> who is also a filmmaker and does documentary-based work, it was really helpful to have her. It was quite a short turn around, we got awarded funding in October and had to show it in December.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>J:<\/strong>&nbsp; Did you have an idea before you got the funding?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>P:<\/strong> I had the idea whilst doing a course with them, but it was definitely a huge learning process. I knew during production I wanted to work with people I already knew, as I felt it makes the process easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>J:<\/strong> Where did the subject matter come from?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>P: <\/strong>Me and Jordan have been friends for years. We went to school together, so we already had a relationship and then we lost contact, going to different colleges. We then rekindled our friendship and spoke about how we wanted to document his transition, initially not to be shown, it was just for him. We didn\u2019t think it was going to be commissioned or anything, so it\u2019s nice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>J: <\/strong>&nbsp;In the future would you keep with the same documentary style?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>P: <\/strong>I think so yeah, it\u2019s funny right after we screened it a lot of people were like what\u2019s your next thing, but my heart was in this project for so long. I don\u2019t want to make something for the sake of it, I want it to be more organic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>J:<\/strong> Definitely, you can kind of tell when a story is close to someone a lot of love goes into it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>P: <\/strong>Making a film on someone else\u2019s life, it\u2019s important to remind yourself that it has to be a collaborative project, it can&#8217;t just be exploiting someone&#8217;s story, that\u2019s not what a documentary is about. Speaking with Jordan he wanted to make this film because when he was younger there was no one on screens that he looked like or he in any way could resonate with so it was one of the main aims of the film. It&#8217;s important to establish that when going forward in making documentary, it\u2019ll be a collaboration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>J<\/strong>: What was the course at the Roundhouse, perhaps others could benefit from it too?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>P: <\/strong>Yeah the course is amazing! I mean before it I was working in a chocolate factory, It really opened a lot of doors\u2026It\u2019s called the Bloomburg broadcast, hopefully it\u2019s still running. It\u2019s a 6 week course for 18-25 year-olds and all about the life broadcasting they do at the Roundhouse, for producing, editing, you learn so much it&#8217;s great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>J:<\/strong> That\u2019s amazing, when you have ideas that you really want to execute, having backing from an organization like the Roundhouse is great, and has allowed you to make such a lovely and polished piece. We love it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"footer\">To stay updated about future projects by Phoebe, follow her on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/phoebe_langley\/\" data-type=\"URL\">Instagram<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/phoebe_langley?lang=en\" data-type=\"URL\">Twitter<\/a>.
