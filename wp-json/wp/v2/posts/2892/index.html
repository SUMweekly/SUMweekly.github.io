To maintain his persona of relentless irritability, there was an abundance of things to be pissed off about. The weather, Southern Rail, everything being expensive, immigrants, Southern Rail &#8211; the list continues. It was with this frame of mind that Gary reluctantly spread his wings, welcoming a new day already dry with disappointment. It was 7:23 on Wednesday morning and the air was soggy and smelt of petrol. Gary could hear the C2 bus rumble across the road, London remerging from what was probably an eventful night yet not in Gary\u2019s memory. His night had involved sitting on top of a lamppost for five hours straight. It was a stale one-dimensional shade of grey.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"818\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/birb-818x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2896\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/birb-818x1024.jpg 818w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/birb-768x961.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/birb-1227x1536.jpg 1227w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/birb-1320x1652.jpg 1320w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/birb.jpg 1637w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 818px) 100vw, 818px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Gary was born here, and he knew he\u2019d die here. Only tourists truly believed London was this grand metropolis brimming with opportunity and cosmopolitan commercialism. London now was struggling to find its voice in a post-Brexit world and with a new Pret on every corner, things were looking hopeful. However, Gary knew otherwise. London was shedding a new skin, but no one knew if the beast beneath would be wonderful or monstrous. Gary remembered discussing the current political climate when his cousins from New York came and visited last summer. Arrogant, obnoxious birds, tweeting whatever came into their heads, he thought to himself. Yet even those Trans-Atlantic upstarts recognised the problems facing our world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cKelly will have KFC eight times a day if we let her!\u201d cousin Danny remarked. His girlfriend Kelly stood aghast, her mouth full of skinny fries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPigeon obesity has been on the rise ever since the 70s but no one is treating this as a national health risk. I think this is one of the biggest problems facing our world right now\u201d Danny continued, \u201cI noticed when we flew in the number of chicken shops around here has increased.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou know, actually, perhaps we should start taking control of our own diets. I mean, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s kind of psychopathic eating another species of bird, not miles unlike your own, that\u2019s been deep fried, left for hours and then dumped on the pavement?\u201d Gary questioned Danny with the thinly veiled judgment that all vegans inherently possess.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cChickens are nothing like us, Gary, don\u2019t act all high and mighty. Humans do it all the time. Rich and poor, ain\u2019t the same brand of people. Democrats and Republicans, hardly the same species.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can\u2019t disagree with that. Gary left Danny and Kelly outside of Chicken Cottage and took a 5-minute flight to the Hampstead Heath Farmers\u2019 Market. He found a leftover apple and kale muffin, pecking it with a slightly deflated self-righteousness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-default\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>It was 7:45 when Gary began to make his way to Trafalgar Square. He transcended the green expanses of Regents Park, briefly losing sight of Mornington Crescent\u2019s dingy side alleys. With the sun peeking over the tops of buildings, the grey sky momentarily looked promising. However, Gary was a pigeon with poor imagination. His stubborn bird brain was unable to imagine a future with anything more glorious in it, than an Arsenal win over Tottenham in the greatest derby of all time. Instead, Gary was aware of how crap everything is. He wore the mantle of being so woke, life had become meaningless. He was disillusioned rather than revolutionary. He knew he was more spiritually, politically and educationally enlightened than most other pigeons, and this made him feel sad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gary\u2019s social commentary continued as he flew solo through TheatreLand. Show after show promised dazzling sets and enchanting stories, enough to convince the most sombre of pigeons that life could be magical. But, Gary was flying low at 8:09 and there was nothing magical about London on its groggy wake up call.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, Gary began his descent into Trafalgar Square. Each morning he would take a bird\u2019s eye view of London situated upon the 169 feet and 3 inches of Nelson\u2019s Column. And there he would offer his oblation to the Empire. He would crap on Nelson\u2019s head. Bloody colonialism.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From that great height Gary could see from Big Ben to the London Eye to Buckingham Palace. Beneath him was the usual bustle of commuters crawling out of Charing Cross tube station. One or two buskers were setting up for the morning, checking guitar strings, warming their voices. It was 8:26 now. Gary, no longer astride Nelson\u2019s head but firmly rooted on the ground, arched his neck back, distractedly rearranging his feathers. He realised he hadn\u2019t had breakfast yet and so decided to amble along in search for any puddles of spilt coffee or the odd piece of sourdough toast. He hadn\u2019t gone far when an incredibly offensive sound pierced the morning air. It was his least favourite musical collective: \u2018Urban Vermin\u2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOi Percy!\u201d Gary yelled at the late pubescent pigeon named Percy. \u201cGive it a rest, alright! Take a ride to Croydon, I\u2019d love to see what the real birds of grime think of your bars.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHello Gary!\u201d Percy cheerily replied, enthusiastically waving his left wing over towards Gary. He was well-meaning, but more entitled than the peacocks of Holland Park. Everything had changed when he took a trip to Peru, met a free-thinking blue-and-gold macaw and totally found himself. Gary despised this kind of imported consciousness. His own awakening was home-grown and therefore much more genuine than this flight-risk tourist\u2019s attitude.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Gary answered. \u201cCould you give it rest though mate?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI know you might not yet be a fan yet,\u201d Percy acknowledged, \u201cbut as music evolves so does the pigeon. It started with 90s hip-hop, R+B, the spoken word poetry of London\u2019s lowliest and now grime\u2019s hit the scene and the channels between back garden and parliament have never been so accessible.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFabulous. Sure. Whatever. \u2018This is a movement not a moment\u2019. Great. You\u2019re from Haywards Heath, mate. Just calm down.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gary had been scanning his surroundings, not really looking at Percy at all during this little conversation when suddenly his eyes stopped as they reached the fountain. Then at 8:34 on Wednesday morning, Gary\u2019s life changed forever.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-default\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>He remembered as a young pigeon visiting his paternal Grandparents in Berkshire on bank holiday weekends. His family were fortunate enough not to feel threatened by the mass shootings of rich men in tweed who still indulged in Tudor-esque delicacies, so these childhood memories always stayed pure in Gary\u2019s mind. In fact, Gary remembered watching the sunrise on a clear Sunday morning across the wide-open fields and thinking this was the most beautiful thing he would ever see. But it turns out he was mistaken.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sunlight glistened on the water in the fountain, full classical elegance. There in the centre of the foundation emerged a figure in white, beads of water cascading down her back. As David gazed upon Bathsheba, Gary became transfixed by this angelic creature. A rush of warmth flooded through his body like nothing he\u2019d experienced before. She was divine. She was glowing. She was a seagull.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWow&#8230;she is a fit bird!\u201d Percy wasn\u2019t a feminist. \u201cHey Gary, be my wingman mate. \u201cNo.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gary stuck out a wing to stop the eager pigeon. This opportunity was too precious to let fly away. His Wednesday morning had just begun to open up. So, Gary stuck out a foot and made his way across Trafalgar Square.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-default\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>She was mid bird bath when Gary reached the fountain.\u201cRespectful yet speak with initiative. Women don\u2019t want to be told what they like and they<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>will <\/em>like someone who knows that. Just be intentionally nonchalant and don\u2019t overthink.\u201d This was Gary\u2019s inner dialogue whilst he fluffed his feathers and sauntered over.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cRight, listen, I\u2019ve had enough. You know this is a tough day for me and I deserve something to take my mind off things as much as anyone else. You\u2019re supposed to be supporting me, not criticising my life choices!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDarling, you need to stop making such a fuss. If you need to go and make your break in the city, sobeit, just don\u2019t blame me when it all goes south.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMUM! Honestly, you\u2019re upsetting my aura and I cannot be dealing with this much negative energy so close to a Cancer full moon.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gary tried his best not to look too obvious as he listened over his shoulder to this mother and daughter spat. It appeared the angel of the fountain was facing a duel with her less liberal mother about flying the nest. Gary was not usually one to throw around gender stereotypes but it had often been the case that mother birds were guilty of suffocating their poor chicks with a constant clucking that would drive any woman insane.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI actually can\u2019t deal with this right now.\u201d \u201cOh honestly, stop being so dramatic!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNo, mum, I need some space. I\u2019ll meet you back on the hospital roof later but right now I need to explore my journey without your toxic energy.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf you say so, dear.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With an unflattering grunt, the old bird lifted into the sky and made her way to goodness knows where.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The younger seagull sat whimsically by the water. It was now or now or never for Gary and he felt his chances for an introduction growing smaller and smaller. With a flash he saw himself tomorrow morning, Thursday, the same stale air, the same bleak prospects. This future was not what Gary envisioned. Life could not be so cruel. He had to make his dreams come because if not, who would?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHey, I heard you\u2019ve come to the city for your big break? Would you be happy with me asking exactly what you\u2019re hoping to pursue?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Was that too forward? Confident or creepy? Gary could never tell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah, I\u2019m a singer-songwriter originally from Brighton. I\u2019m kinda on a R\u2019n\u2019B, gospel, indie, alt slightly punk with soft jazzy undertones kinda vibe. But I\u2019m also experimenting with freestyle grime. Do you want to hear some?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The deja vu sent shivers down Gary\u2019s spine. He quickly glanced to see if Percy was still in his eyeline but \u2018Urban Vermin\u2019 had finally dispersed. The dream was beginning to shatter but being British he felt compelled to smile and say \u201csure!\u201d with perfectly fake enthusiasm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sound that came out of the angel\u2019s beak was not what Gary expected. When humans hear seagulls singing they usually wince at the high pitched wail but when the seagull song reaches a pigeon\u2019s eardrum, something magical happens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gary firmly did not believe in love at first sight. But the sound of this song changed everything he knew to be real. Love was pumping through his little pigeon veins. It was as if the world stopped spinning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hordes of foreign exchange students milled around the Square, some draping themselves across the Lions, others obnoxiously using selfie sticks, or watching street entertainers not quite entertain the crowds. They had come to London to see if it was like in the movies. Hard and gritty, but full of adventures and romance. Gary realised that for London to appear to be all these things, there must be something behind it. Something real to make the fiction believable. And for these happy endings to exist, pigeons like Gary must make them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a demo but what do you think?\u201d\u201cI love you. It! I love IT! Great! Amazing! Such depth! What\u2019s your name by the way?\u201d If seagulls could blush, this one was.\u201cStella. I\u2019m Stella\u201d.\u201cHi Stella, I\u2019m Gary.\u201d&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"footer\"> \nPart 2 coming next week!
