Alongside <a href=\"https:\/\/www.liverpoolecho.co.uk\/news\/liverpool-news\/travellers-could-imprisoned-setting-up-20190702\">brutal further oppression of traveller communities<\/a>, the bill further enshrines the criminalisation of protest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The law is intentionally vague, allowing very loose, case-by-case interpretation by the government and police. The bill permits police crackdown on any protest for causing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigissue.com\/latest\/social-activism\/how-priti-patels-new-policing-bill-threatens-your-right-to-protest\/\">\u201cserious annoyance, inconvenience or loss of amenity\u201d<\/a> to the surrounding community, organisations and businesses. Any individual deemed as being responsible &#8211; likely organizers, though definitions of responsibility could apply to participants, could face a jail sentence of up to 10 years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bill also scraps legislation that caps sentencing at three months for damage of less than \u00a35000, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thejusticegap.com\/assault-on-our-rights-new-justice-bill-threatens-clampdown-on-protest-and-runaway-sentence-inflation\/\">increasing it to a max of 10 years<\/a>. Allowing for the harsh sentencing of anyone who might damage a statue, smash the window of a bank etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Justice Secretary Robert Buckland QC <a href=\"https:\/\/insidetime.org\/no-one-will-serve-10-years-for-damaging-statues-government-admits\/\">told the Commons<\/a> it \u201censures our courts have sufficient sentencing powers to punish the <em>emotional harm<\/em> caused by this type of offending\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>This is one of the most authoritarian moves we have seen in Britain in decades, and within the wider context of conservative legislation, poses a fundamental threat to democracy, freedom. And it must be opposed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So why is it that this bill has been put into motion? What is it about protests that the conservatives feel compelled to stop?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This bill appears to be crafted in direct response to the two major protest movements that have taken place in recent years \u2013 Black Lives Matter, and Extinction Rebellion. These protests were both disruptive, wide spread and massively influential in their own right, and so, were regarded by home secretary Priti Patel as extreme annoyances, going so far as to paint the more radical individuals participating in protest as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/politics\/video\/2020\/jun\/08\/you-will-face-justice-priti-patel-condemns-minority-of-thugs-at-uk-anti-racism-protests-video\">thugs<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2020\/sep\/08\/extinction-rebellion-criminals-threaten-uks-way-of-life-says-priti-patel\">criminals<\/a>\u2026<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"679\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/crop3-679x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/crop3-679x1024.jpg 679w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/crop3-768x1157.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/crop3-1019x1536.jpg 1019w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/crop3-1320x1989.jpg 1320w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/crop3.jpg 1351w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 679px) 100vw, 679px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, the threat the Conservatives feel these movements pose legitimises their intention of legislating future protest out of existence. This move to pass this bill comes at a time, where institutionally, the left is incredibly weakened.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Labour under Keir Starmer is in complete disrepair, with a leader who is more intent on appealing to an imagined middle England, than actually standing up for what\u2019s right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The right largely dominates the media, with most mainstream voices failing to hold the government to account, stand up for marginalised groups, and question the status quo.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much of the BBC plays into the hands of the conservatives (in particular News Broadcasts and Radio 4). Discussions are framed by whichever guests are brought on, with economic ideas generally being set only as left as centrism. Further, the \u201cUK\u2019s leading journalists\u201d seem generally confused, as to whether their role is to act as government broadcaster, or, to hold power to account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/horsies4-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2458\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/horsies4-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/horsies4-768x513.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/horsies4-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/horsies4-1320x881.jpg 1320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A clear example of this come through in their publishing of what is, effectively propaganda, in the form of<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BBCPolitics\/status\/1367089120267407363\"> pro Rishi Sunak reports<\/a>. Though they manifest in far more subtle ways&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/downloads.bbc.co.uk\/bbctrust\/assets\/files\/pdf\/our_work\/breadth_opinion\/content_analysis.pdf\">study<\/a> carried out by researchers at Cardiff University, who analysed BBC news coverage from 2007 and 2012, concluded that conservative opinions received more airtime than progressive ones. However, those findings contradict a 2013 <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cps.org.uk\/files\/reports\/original\/130814102945-BBCBiasOliverLathamfc.pdf\">report<\/a> by the Centre for Policy Studies think tank which claimed that the corporation is biased towards the left.&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theweek.co.uk\/100501\/is-the-bbc-biased\">The Week<\/a>) &#8211; The Centre for policy studies was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cps.org.uk\/about\/\">founded by Margaret Thatcher<\/a> (more resources on media bias here: <a href=\"https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/1464884916648094\">[4]<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/jacobinmag.com\/2019\/12\/bbc-media-bias-boris-johnson-uk\">[5]<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further moves to co-opt the media are evident in the imposition of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk\/read-this\/new-bbc-chairman-richard-sharp-has-donated-ps400k-conservative-party-2001-3088420\">a tory donor as the chairman of the BBC<\/a>, and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitaltveurope.com\/2021\/02\/01\/paul-dacre-set-to-be-announced-as-ofcom-chair\/\">former chief Daily Mail editor as the head of OFCOM<\/a> (Communications Regulator) setting the stage for a fundamentally different UK television broadcast landscape, with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/02\/16\/world\/europe\/murdoch-uk-news-channel.html\">the start of GB News<\/a>, parroting Fox news, where \u2013 reality is irrelevant. Any further shift to the right of the BBC would appear sane in comparison.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tories have also set their sights on universities, imposing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2021\/feb\/14\/government-to-appoint-free-speech-champion-for-universities-heritage-history-cancel-culture\">\u201cfree speech champions\u201d<\/a> off the back of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/education\/2016\/may\/05\/boris-tatchell-greer-were-they-actually-no-platformed\">misrepresentations of \u201cde-platorming\u201d<\/a>, and complaints from a conservative students with severe victim complexes. A move which increases pressure on universities, out of fear for their position as left wing spaces.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, through avenues of grassroots movements, culture, social media, and mass protest \u2013 the Conservatives have been posed with a threat, realms in which influence and control are resisted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns collapse-below-right\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"679\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/crop5-679x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2453\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/crop5-679x1024.jpg 679w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/crop5-768x1159.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/crop5-1018x1536.jpg 1018w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/crop5-1320x1991.jpg 1320w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/crop5.jpg 1345w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 679px) 100vw, 679px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>Nothing infuriates them more than the discussion, exchange, proliferation of ideas, and protest in response to injustices. Spaces through which we are able to break through the narratives of the media, bringing topics into the mainstream and challenging power. Without them, the scope of ideas and representation in the public realm would be greatly limited. And thus, are crucial to a functioning democracy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s almost humorous, that at the same time this bill was passed, the secretary of state <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-politics-56423716\">stated that democracy globally is under retreat<\/a>, and that the UK government must play its role in furthering it globally. Since the 2019 protests the government has engaged in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2020\/jun\/01\/seven-former-foreign-secretaries-urge-uk-to-take-lead-on-hong-kong\">numerous discussions over concerns for the liberties of the Hong Kong people<\/a>, under the tyranny of the Chinese government.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>During the peak of the Hong Kong protests, protestors attending unpermitted protests could be subject to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hklii.hk\/en\/legis\/ord\/245\/s18\">maximum penalty of 5 years<\/a>, a policy not a million miles from the level of criminalisation found in our own policing bill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is beauty in the resistance of protests. The power of standing in a crowd of people who share your concerns, and dreams; creating a space in which, we temporarily break from the narratives we live under.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Making your voice heard, and pushing to assert positive change is powerful. And represents one of the few realms we have to politically engage and affect change, in a system where real democracy remains elusive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"690\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/crop6-1024x690.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2454\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/crop6-1024x690.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/crop6-768x518.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/crop6-1536x1036.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/crop6-1320x890.jpg 1320w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/crop6.jpg 2029w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"subhead\">ON BRISTOL<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Since writing this article, the Kill the Bill protest in Bristol, and the &#8220;violence&#8221; thereof, has become the defining moment for the broader resistance to this bill, receiving far more mainstream coverage than the bill itself ever had. Though accusations of violence are shaky at this point, given the Bristol Police having <a href=\"https:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.co.uk\/entry\/bristol-police-broken-bones-kill-bill-protests_uk_605c5d00c5b6531eed021915\">lied about broken bones and a punctured lung<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I do not condone the use of \u201cviolence\u201d in this context, I certainly do not think we should outright condemn it. Nor should we let it distract us from the context within which it arose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, violence is a product of anger, and anger is a legitimate response to the state of this country, especially from those who are most on the receiving end. The violence of the British state is immense and multifaceted, in its <a href=\"https:\/\/greenworld.org.uk\/article\/uk-immigration-detention-centres-dehumanising-and-traumatic\">treatment of refugees<\/a>, traveller communities, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bristolpost.co.uk\/news\/stop-search-disparity-compounds-distrust-5206638\">poor black communities<\/a>, and so on&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this violence may not be tactical, and it would be preferable for it not to have happened, we should not allow it to divide us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The labour opposition to this bill was tenuous, and would have amounted to moderate revisions to the bill at best. But it remains true that public consensus behind movements for them to be effectual is a need (though not a metric for morality). In this context, perceptions of violence may turn away some individuals who are sympathetic. Gauging a public mood in this moment though is difficult, especially with of a large demographic of disillusioned people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite what has happened, the way forward continues in grassroots movements in response to the government. Direct action, community organising, strikes, social media campaigns, flyposting and protesting. The bill has been delayed until &#8220;later this year&#8221;, a move which we cannot allow to diffuse the momentum and resistance against it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"footer\"> \nWriting and Photography by \n<a href=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/?tag=james-farrant\" data-type=\"URL\">James Farrant<\/a>.\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div id=spanwrap> On the 16th March, the British parliament passed the \u201cPolice, Crime, Sentencing<span id=span1> &#8230;<\/span><span id=span2> and Courts Bill\u201d, with 359 votes for, to 225 votes against.
