While he has practiced traditional forms of art since a very young age, his artistic journey became the focal point of his life after taking residence in the Westword award winning DIY house venue known as Mouth House in the 5-points area of Denver in 2010.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My approach to making art is heavily influenced by the work of people like Carl Jung, Joseph Campbell, as well as other thinkers, writers, musicians, filmmakers, and artists in general who concern themselves with engaging the subconscious and detailing the unseen. I&#8217;ve always thought of creating as a method of waking dreaming, a way to access areas of the subconscious through making work that is satisfying to me. Sometimes a piece&#8217;s meaning to me is clear while I&#8217;m creating&nbsp;it and sometimes it&#8217;s not until weeks, months, or years later that I look back and understand why I chose to create certain imagery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, I may make something that feels serious while im creating it, and then I look back on it and it&#8217;s&nbsp;actually a funny and ridiculous concept, or maybe I make something that I find humorous and then later realize that humor was a window into a more serious issue. So in that way it kind of is a dialogue with some level of unconscious\/subconscious psyche which can be very helpful and supportive of my evolution as an artist, father, and just as a human being in general.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lately, I&#8217;ve been finding a lot of interest in Asian culture and specifically japanese folklore. It&#8217;s fascinating to me how long cultures in that part of the world have been developing and flourishing and how vibrant their histories are. Not to mention, since I was a kid, I&#8217;ve always loved japanese culture as it&#8217;s been presented in the context of American culture via films, anime, manga, and video games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my most recent work has been pointed in that direction and I&#8217;ve been really enjoying learning about old Japanese folklore and myths and how they&#8217;ve changed given what period of history they were in and what was going on in the country. Some pieces feel like direct interpretations and some feel more loosely influenced by these stories and I&#8217;m kind of interpreting them in my own way.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"footer\"> \nTo see more work by Richard, follow him on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/grave.daisy\/\" data-type=\"URL\">Instagram<\/a>.<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div id=spanwrap> I&#8217;ve always thought of creating as a method of waking dreaming<span id=span1> &#8230;<\/span><span id=span2>, a way to access areas of the subconscious through making work that is satisfying to me.
