Since the start of the pandemic, they have also struck out a path as a digital artist and illustrator, finding inspiration in the LGBTQ+ community, and their Nigerian Heritage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While giving an insight to life as a professional scientist, Kemi offers a look into the hurdles a person of colour faces when pursuing a career in STEM.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Noah started off by asking Kemi about their work in industry&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p><strong>N:<\/strong> How would you describe your work in chemistry, to an uneducated fool such as myself?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>K:<\/strong> Up until recently my role was an analytical chemist and toxicologist. Making up dilutions and finding unknown compounds in samples. In the past I\u2019ve worked in environmental settings and more recently in drug analysis, where I\u2019ve tried to analyse drugs in biological samples such as urine and blood. That was all until April, from then onwards I\u2019ve been working as a freelance illustrator and digital artist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>N: <\/strong>Out of interest, what is the most interesting sample you have ever worked on when doing drug analysis?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>K:<\/strong> None in that role actually. I guess I\u2019ve found a lot of weirdly coloured samples especially with the urine, that makes you question whether it\u2019s even come from a human. Some people need to drink more water\u2026<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/KemiBright-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-670\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/KemiBright-683x1024.jpg 683w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/KemiBright-768x1152.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/KemiBright-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/KemiBright.jpg 1365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>N:<\/strong> Have you ever analysed a sample sent from a business and thought \u2018This person is about to lose their job\u2019 considering what you\u2019ve found?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>K:<\/strong> I probably haven\u2019t verbalised it in the lab, but I sometimes wonder how much this person must have ingested. Particularly with fat-soluble drugs such as marijuana which can take up to maybe three or four months to entirely clear from your system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For one of my master\u2019s projects, I was looking at how taking CBD products can result in a positive result in a drugs test. Obviously it depends on how much you take but there have been cases, so watch out!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>N:<\/strong> So do you think the next step for you is to do a PhD?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>K:<\/strong> It\u2019s a bit weird.. I think I\u2019m lowkey bonded with academia and that every time I feel I\u2019m done with education and university I always end up coming back. I\u2019ve always joked with my friends that I\u2019ll never get a \u201creal job\u201d and will stay on to become a lecturer\u2026professor\u2026 but I still want to explore my artistic side and spend some time on that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>N: <\/strong>From my point of view Coventry and Kings seem quite different in terms of diversity, both in the students and lecturers, what was your experience of that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>K: <\/strong>I found that there was more diversity with students at Coventry than in Kings, which is really bizarre when you think about it because I feel London is a very diverse city in general. There were some black and Asian lecturers I noticed in other science departments in Coventry, but not many in my one. In comparison at Kings, I did not see much diversity, in my campus at least.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"706\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/KemiGreen1_bimg2-706x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-664\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/KemiGreen1_bimg2-706x1024.jpg 706w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/KemiGreen1_bimg2-768x1114.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/KemiGreen1_bimg2-1059x1536.jpg 1059w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/KemiGreen1_bimg2.jpg 1365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 706px) 100vw, 706px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p><strong>N: <\/strong>If prompted do you think you would be able to name two black Professors who taught or interacted with you at Kings?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>K:<\/strong> Definitely not. I find it very shocking when people say they have had a black professor lecture them, as I think I\u2019ve only seen one in my life and I only know one person who have had a black professor teach them consistently through their degree (neuroscience).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>N:<\/strong> Where do you think this happens, the cut-off point where many black and minority people fail to progress to higher levels of academia?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>K:<\/strong> I think that right off the jump there are fewer black people wanting to do STEM subjects, with many opting do go for subjects such as law or business. Then those who do chose to do a science subject will usually go for the biological sciences, with even fewer going for chemistry or physics.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that there is this impression that black people do not do fundamental science\u2026 a lot 1st generation black British students will have parents wanting them to do subjects such as medicine or law.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When considering people progressing to professor-level I think it\u2019s since the visibility just isn\u2019t there. It\u2019s harder for people of colour and especially black people to make it to that status. I\u2019ve heard from Post-Docs and PhD students that the effort just is not made by Universities to get black people into these positions. Most of them stay on the same sort of level and are not able to progress or they\u2019re treated with bias. These things will happen from school all the to Post-Doc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>N:<\/strong> So there are just hurdles at every step of the way, which makes the final professorship so unattainable, that very few non-white people manage to get there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>K: <\/strong>Exactly. Some people argue that science isn\u2019t political. In my view most science objects are headed by white, cishet (cis-gender and heterosexual) men\u2026 how could it not be? It\u2019s almost as if it\u2019s like an exclusive club, and that exclusivity makes it much harder for people like us to reach the top.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until that sort of system can be dismantled, or at least until there is some form of allyship to help people of colour to get to that level, there won\u2019t be a change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>N:<\/strong> I found it surprising that when comparing Universities and academia to the traditionally \u201cOld Boys Club\u201d professions of banking and law, there doesn\u2019t seem to be many POC-aimed internships and drives to improve representation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>K:<\/strong> I hear it, you\u2019d definitely think that there would be some sort of effort made. With the resurgence of the BLM movements, these institutions were blagging \u201cwelcoming all kinds of students from all walks of life\u2026\u201d and it just doesn\u2019t show in their statistics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think another factor in why black kids don\u2019t want to go into these fields is who they have to look up to. When they think of biology, chemistry and physics they literally see old white guys in lab coats. Those are the only people they see in school; they don\u2019t know about black people who are doing this right now, they don\u2019t know about younger people like you and I doing science right now. The visibility isn\u2019t there\u2026 I can see why people are being turned off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>N: <\/strong>What kind of initiatives and ideas would you suggest to improve things?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>K:<\/b> Well there has been an effort already. There\u2019s an  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.acrcollective.com\/projects\" data-type=\"URL\">Afro-Caribbean researchers collective<\/a> from people around the UK, and similar groups. But these are groups and collectives that we\u2019ve had to create ourselves to see our own visibility; we have to be the change we want to see.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By forming these groups and trying to build connections with universities and going into schools we can definitely try to encourage black kids to see STEM as an option. That coupled with actually being able to see esteemed black scientists in the field, doing lectures and running workshops\u2026hopefully we can see a change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"footer\"> \nKemi runs <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CreativesInSTEM\" data-type=\"URL\">Creatives in STEM<\/a>, and can also be contacted via\n<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Imekulo\" data-type=\"URL\">Twitter<\/a> or<a href=\"mailto:kxmolo_@hotmail.com\" data-type=\"URL\"> Email<\/a>.
