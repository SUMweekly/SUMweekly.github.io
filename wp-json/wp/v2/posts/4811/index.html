I am an 18 year old vocalist, multi-instrumentalist and producer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns collapse-above-right\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p><strong>What are your aspirations as a musician and how are you going to get there?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually I want to sell my own music in my own name, or as a group amongst friends if I\u2019m lucky enough. The perfect example would be Ezra Collective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see people like <em>Joe Armon-Jones<\/em> in the group who is also killing it with his own personal projects, not to mention <em>Femi Koleoso<\/em>, who was previously <em>Jorja Smith<\/em>\u2019s drummer and is now part of<em> Gorillaz<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What was the last song you listened to that made you feel something?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can\u2019t lie man, while having a proper dig back into some old <em>Alfa Mist<\/em>, there was something about<em> \u2018Falling\u2019 <\/em>featuring <em>Kaya Thomas-Dyke<\/em> on vocals, off his album \u2018Structuralism\u2019, that made me so emotionally attached to so many different things. <\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/jacob-6resized-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4813\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/jacob-6resized-683x1024.jpg 683w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/jacob-6resized-768x1152.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/jacob-6resized-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/jacob-6resized-1320x1980.jpg 1320w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/jacob-6resized.jpg 1366w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether that be the songwriting, the instrumentation or how the music was sonically. Whenever I listen to \u2018Falling\u2019 I get goosebumps every time, leaving me inspired to look more into sound design and have more of a range of instruments in my music.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Give me a your ideal band, you&#8217;re playing bass, who are the others?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve been thinking about this a lot lately after numerous conversations with people who are keen to get writing and making some music. I\u2019d look at my lineup in two ways. The way I\u2019m looking to write music is both with my vocals and also instrumental. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns collapse-above-left\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/jacob-10resized-1-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4819\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/jacob-10resized-1-683x1024.jpg 683w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/jacob-10resized-1-768x1152.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/jacob-10resized-1-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/jacob-10resized-1-1320x1980.jpg 1320w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/jacob-10resized-1.jpg 1366w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>This is heavily inspired by a saxophonist and producer named <em>Venna<\/em>. He has a project out which is part instrumental and part vocal. So, in an instrumental situation, I\u2019d be on bass, my friend <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/luciamusicc\/\">Lucia<\/a>, would be on keys, vocals and trumpet. I\u2019d have my bro <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/lox_drumz\/\">Ebz<\/a> on drums and then the one and only <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/benglassermusic\/\">Ben Glasser<\/a> on electric guitar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a situation where I\u2019d be on vocals, I\u2019m absolutely spoiled for choice for a bassist. I could have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/kavitron.exe\/\">Kavi<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/kobeheathngugi\/\">Kobe <\/a>or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/patchsawyer\/\">Patch<\/a> on bass, in a situation where they could all take part or have gigs at a time because they\u2019re all killing bassists and amazing people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This also made me think about how when I\u2019m not singing, I could also hop on trombone, for a melody or when soloing. I feel like this group could really hold it down well. It gets me excited just speaking about it, let alone actually playing with them.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do you feel nervous before a gig? How do you cope?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My honest answer is, no, not really. Since I\u2019ve started doing gigs, I\u2019ve kept this mentality of \u2018treat it just like practice\u2019 and I almost picture as if not a single person is there watching me, so I have nothing to worry about. While having good energy on stage is key, I\u2018ve really been working on holding it down and keeping things simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How do you feel about the future?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m quite excited about what the future holds. Every now and then it\u2019s very easy to get ahead of myself and have flashes of seeing my name in shining lights, going on tour, the things you dream of as a musician. But, obviously, these things don\u2019t come without grit, determination and hard work. So, right now I\u2019m just trying my best to stay grounded, continuing to work hard, taking the right paths and guidance from people, with the hopes of achieving big and that good things come my way eventually.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/jacob-7resized-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4816\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/jacob-7resized-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/jacob-7resized-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/jacob-7resized-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/jacob-7resized-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/jacob-7resized-1320x880.jpg 1320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"footer\"> \nKeep track of Jacob via his <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/jacobm4y\/\" data-type=\"URL\">Instagram<\/a>, Jacob will also be playing with rising Neo-soul star Saffiyah on the 28th of November.<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div id=spanwrap> From popping up at jazz jams with his trombone to keeping the rhythm section tight <span id=span1>&#8230;<\/span><span id=span2>. with his bass guitar, multi-instrumentalist Jacob seems to be <\/span><span id=span3> &#8230;<\/span><span id=span4> everywhere at the moment.
