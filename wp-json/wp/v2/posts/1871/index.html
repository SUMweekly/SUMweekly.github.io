Is it where your parents are? Is it the city you were born in or where your books are?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was born in London. I grew up here, mainly in the South, but lived all over the city in different places with either my mom or dad, neither of which live here anymore. However, when people ask me where I\u2019m from I tend to say Canada. I have spent most of my life visiting my grandparents\u2019 farm every summer in Southey, a tiny town with a population of 400, about forty minutes from the capital of Saskatchewan called Regina, affectionately known as the city that rhymes with fun. The land still seems unfathomably endless to this day. Most people associate \u2018home\u2019 with family and friends &#8211; I associate it with the smells and sounds of the one unchanged and unmoved place in my life. My mom says it\u2019s where she would go to recharge when returning from being away at university or work and I too see it that way now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1921\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4-1320x990.jpg 1320w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image4.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve never spent longer than three years in one place in London and I suspect a lot of people can relate. My memories of these flats and houses are vague and jumbled together and I don\u2019t have any standout moments or specific times that I can recall. But, on my grandparents\u2019 farm, there are two trees, they were planted when I was born and every time I go back there they are, they are as old as me. They\u2019ve weathered the same number of winters as I have, they will always stand there and have always had something that London has lacked; consistency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I understand that having the option of calling two places home is rare, especially when one allows you to remove yourself from the chaos of the city; enter stillness and calm, and the other is full of culture, diversity and belonging. My slightly skewed definition of \u2018home\u2019 does not make it negative, the dual citizenship I hold is something I will always be appreciative of and count myself incredibly fortunate.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image3-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1923\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image3-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image3-1320x880.jpg 1320w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image3.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the popular idiom \u2018home is where the heart is\u2019 makes an exception in some cases; London is where my friends are, the city I know and the streets I\u2019ve grown up on, where I am surrounded by people who love me and who I identify with, but again, that doesn\u2019t satisfy my own definition. Instead, I see London as a base for everything to start and expand from, &#8220;Home&#8221; for me is yourself. It\u2019s where you are at your best and secretly your worst. It\u2019s that place where you can feel yourself without trying. Where your guard is down and self-defence is your last concern.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1924\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1-1320x880.jpg 1320w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/image1.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So, when people ask me \u2018Where are you from\u2019; my knee jerk is Canada, which is \u2018technically\u2019 incorrect. But, when I\u2019m driving up the dirt road to the yard and hear the crickets, it feels more like I\u2019m returning than visiting, and seeing London from the sky on the inbound flight always makes me feel out of sorts. I guess home for me is where I hold memories, where I have an anchor, and where I know I can always breathe, home is not temporary for me, it is that one unwavering place.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"footer\"> \nTo keep up with Anna&#8217;s work, follow her<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/annasaltmarsh\/\" data-type=\"URL\"> Instagram<\/a>.<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div id=spanwrap>&#8220;In recent years I\u2019ve struggled to answer this question &#8211; where is home?
