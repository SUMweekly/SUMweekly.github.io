The 15th of September was no exception to this. Despite permission being withdrawn by the police, the unrelenting nature of the movement again made itself apparent. Standing at the entrance to Causeway Bay metro station you see a sea of masked faces already gathered, and hundreds more still continuing to appear, seemingly from thin air. The same normally unremarkable passengers who ride the metro with you, begin donning the attire synonymous with the protests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"705\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/3-copy-2-2-705x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/3-copy-2-2-705x1024.jpg 705w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/3-copy-2-2-207x300.jpg 207w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/3-copy-2-2-768x1115.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/3-copy-2-2-1058x1536.jpg 1058w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/3-copy-2-2-1411x2048.jpg 1411w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/3-copy-2-2-scaled.jpg 1763w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 705px) 100vw, 705px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"705\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/dm-1-705x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-148\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/dm-1-705x1024.jpg 705w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/dm-1-207x300.jpg 207w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/dm-1-768x1115.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/dm-1-1058x1536.jpg 1058w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/dm-1-1411x2048.jpg 1411w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/dm-1-scaled.jpg 1763w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 705px) 100vw, 705px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here you begin to see the dividing line between those who identify themselves as \u201cWo Lei Fei\u201d (\u548c\u7406\u975e), the non-violent protesters dressed more casually for the occasion. And the \u201cYung Mo\u201d (\u52c7\u6b66) or \u201cValiant\u201d. Those who come well prepared for the inevitable confrontations, more often dressed in black, and carrying protective gear. Despite the distinctions however, there is one thing they all have in common, face masks. Staring into the crowds, they\u2019re almost universal.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-6211467a1e0c8 wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p>Something which reflects the unified nature of the city\u2019s protestors, despite coming from such varied backgrounds, they all know they must stick together if they are to have any chance of changing the course of the city\u2019s future for the better, to shift the balance of power away from Beijing, and toward democracy. The decision to wear a mask makes a lot of sense, when you consider the maximum penalty for illegal assembly in the city is 5 years in prison. And at just 30km away from Shenzhen, a global technology capital, awareness of the power of surveillance technology in the city is key to ones self-preservation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn\u2019t the only place where technology comes into play in the streets. If the crowds are to have a chance with their rallies and actions, they need to be able to move through the city, making as much of a visible impact as possible whilst still evading the tight restrictions and heavy force placed on them by the police.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, despite the protest being supposedly cancelled by its organisers, the directly democratic means that can be found online, in places such as the LIHKG forum or on the encrypted messaging apps such as Telegram, mean that calls can be put out just hours before the rally, and still be heeded by 10s of thousands. Some of which perhaps may even have been encouraged to attend by the more trivial methods such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/hong-kong-youth-using-tinder-and-pokemon-go-organize-protests-2019-8?r=US&amp;IR=T\" data-type=\"URL\">tinder or even Pok\u00e9mon Go<\/a>,  showing just how pervasive the movement had become. In fact, the very same month it was reported that around 70% of the city were in support of the protests. Something, which as the crowds had formed and begun to march, was not hard to believe, looking out over the sea of umbrellas.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/2.4-copy-705x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-138\" width=\"1400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/2.4-copy-705x1024.jpg 705w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/2.4-copy-207x300.jpg 207w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/2.4-copy-768x1115.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/2.4-copy-1058x1536.jpg 1058w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/2.4-copy-1411x2048.jpg 1411w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/2.4-copy-scaled.jpg 1763w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 705px) 100vw, 705px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"footer\"> \nWriting and Photography by \n<a href=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/?tag=james-farrant\" data-type=\"URL\">James Farrant<\/a>.\nFree Hong Kong!\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div id=spanwrap>Was one of the defining tactics of the protestors who transformed the city of Hong <span id=span1> &#8230;<\/span><span id=span2> Kong throughout 2019.
