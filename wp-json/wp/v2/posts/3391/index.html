There were no words to describe the beauty she possessed. Her feathers were still damp from the fountain. She was all white apart from a line of feathers down by her neck that faded from white to grey. A sexy, discreet shade of grey. She stretched out her wings with a flirtatious flutter. She hadn\u2019t imagined the first day after moving to the city would result in meeting a handsome stranger. He was gentle and introspective, qualities Stella admired in a bird. Not like all the cocks she\u2019d met back in Brighton.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gary had invited her on a tour of London and Stella felt like the unassuming star of a new Netflix rom-com.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/birds-of-a-rpg-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3412\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/birds-of-a-rpg-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/birds-of-a-rpg-768x768.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/birds-of-a-rpg-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/birds-of-a-rpg-200x200.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/birds-of-a-rpg-1320x1320.jpg 1320w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/birds-of-a-rpg.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sumweekly.com\/birds-of-a\">(Part 1 here)<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The scope possibility was more tangible than ever. Her life was about to reach new heights and if the early bird gets the worm, Gary was ready to make this flighty decision for good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-default\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>The number 24 floated north at a pleasantly drowsy speed. London was fully awake, but as Gary and Stella sat on the roof of the bus heading out of London\u2019s epicentre, they were not overwhelmed by noise and flashing lights. Instead, skyscrapers turned to houses and businessmen to shop owners. Trafalgar became Oxford Circus which became Warren Street which morphed into Camden High Street. While they sat, they began to chat. They talked about home and about family. Stella was originally from Brighton. Raised as seaside gulls, London was an unfamiliar place to them. Stella told Gary about her dad who\u2019d left for Devon when she was young for better chips. She told him about this guy she dated a year before you decided to leave for London. He was a pelican called Nigel who\u2019d spent too many years alone at sea that he\u2019d completely forgotten what commitment meant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gary listened enchanted. The inconsistencies, slurs and sloppiness of her speech was so endearing. He told her about his own family. His New York cousins, Berkshire Grandparents, Camden lads and Percy, the grime artist gone cuckoo. They talked about government, global ethics, whether the Marxist revolution will ever happen and if it will solve the problem of the bin strikes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI just sometimes feel as though everyone is forgetting how big the world actually is, and we just need to start being a bit more Bon Jovi, you know what I mean? It\u2019s like what my nan used to say, God bless her, \u2018Don\u2019t be a tit, but have the courage of an eagle and eyes like a hawk\u2019. She was right you know, I wish there were more birds like her in our skies. Have you ever been to New York to visit your cousins? I\u2019d love to go to America! Heck of a long flight though! That\u2019s another thing about my nan, that is, she never flew outside of Brighton. Not once. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, Gary. I mean, like, today. I came to London to take hold of my future and my music and here I am with you. Crazy, isn\u2019t it?! S But anyway Gary, I really like you, I do. Not everyday you meet a pigeon who can show you around London on the top of the bus! Is this our stop?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Gary said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-default\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, they arrived at the top of Primrose Hill. Before him Gary saw a city so full of colours his tiny pigeon head nearly exploded. Never had everything been in such high definition. People walking, sitting, running, talking, laughing, feeling. Gary wasn\u2019t just some passive spectator, watching the world unfold around him, he was here with Stella under his wings, real and alive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhy do you think we met, Gary?\u201d Stella asked, her question assuming a philosophical edge that Gary was uncertain of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Stella. But I\u2019m happy we did. Whatever cosmic force is bringing us together, I\u2019m grateful. If it\u2019s just fate, then perhaps my opinion of determinism has brightened.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOh Gary, you\u2019re such a romantic! I wish I didn\u2019t have to say goodbye.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhy do you mean?\u201d Gary hadn\u2019t meant for his voice to be so panicky, but as soon as the words were said, the air changed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a seagull Gary! I eat candy floss 4 times a day, is candy floss even vegan?! You\u2019re a city bird, a high-flying Londoner. This wouldn\u2019t work.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that point, 16:32 Wednesday afternoon, Gary realised the meaning of life. The world is full of impossibilities, but we can choose to stay perched on our fears forever or we can spread our wings and fly straight through them. Some birds we\u2019re willing to risk our lives for. Others fly right by. Gary knew he\u2019d found the Robin to be his Batman.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cStella, today has been the best day of my life. I don\u2019t want it to end. You\u2019re so beautiful and funny and kind and the way you pronounce \u2018almond\u2019 makes me laugh. I woke up this morning after an evening of sitting on a lamppost. Now I don\u2019t ever want to sit down again! I want to fly everywhere, see everything! Come fly with me, Stella. What do you say?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYeah, ok.\u201d said Stella.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-default\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike most pigeon-seagull relationships, Gary and Stella find their differences bring them closer together rather than further apart. Gary migrated to Brighton and has enjoyed pioneering the gentrification of Brighton\u2019s pier. Percy did not continue in the music industry and now lives in Waterloo station. Kelly died of a heart attack and Danny drank himself to death after having a nasty accident with a British Airways plane on his way home and falling, mouth open into the Atlantic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>London and Brighton are both places spilling with colours, without a dash of grey to be seen. This means for Gary that each morning when he wakes up, still with an expression of being mildly pissed off, he turns and sees Stella. She is a painting, iridescent with colour. She is hope, she is tomorrow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"footer\"> \nPart 2 coming next week!
