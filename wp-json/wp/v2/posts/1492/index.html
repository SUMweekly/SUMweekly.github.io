I hate maths\u2026 absolutely hate it, but I always wanted to be a doctor which I didn\u2019t think would involve much maths. So I did a degree in biomedical science and in my final year took a lot of psychology modules and really enjoyed them. Then I took a year out to work as a teaching assistant with children with autism and now I\u2019m doing a masters in psychology, which I know&nbsp; doesn\u2019t say much about who I am\u2026but it\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in. I used to do a lot of music, but I don\u2019t have the time to do much anymore which is kind of sad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>N<\/strong>: Do you think the intensity of doing a Biomed degree meant that your music was pushed to one side?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>M: <\/strong>A little bit, while I was in London I was actually studying for my performance diploma in first year until it got too much. Now that I\u2019m in Nottingham (studying her Masters) I don\u2019t have access to a piano, and the practice rooms are closed because of Covid so it\u2019s quite hard to play and to find a balance between work and music.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>N: <\/strong>Did you perform much\u2026 or were you more of a bedroom musician?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>M: <\/strong>Both! I used to perform in piano competitions up until last year. It taught me a lot, it was always just me and a bunch of really young piano machines who have been playing since they were three, but it was actually a lot of fun. I\u2019ve been thinking recently about creativity and science. How do you bring your creative side over to science, which can be very controlled and restrictive? Is there room for self-expression in science?<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\" id=\"tiaar\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"960\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/maia.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1494\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\" id=\"biaar\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"736\" height=\"960\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/maia3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1499\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>N: <\/strong>I think there\u2019s a common misconception that science and creativity are two separate entities, and that scientists are generally not creative people. Being a scientist means that you constantly have to be creative\u2026 coming up with new ideas, new theories, new experiments.<strong> &nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>M: <\/strong>I think a lot of it is perspective. When you do something creative, your perspective completely changes, which can have a knock-on effect on other aspects of your life. A lot of what I\u2019ve done throughout my life comes from three things: academia, sport and music. I often think of the ways that music has influenced how I understand sport. Music and dance have definitely affected the way I row as it\u2019s a very rhythmic activity, while ballet has affected my movement in sport and even my approach to science.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>N: <\/strong>I completely agree. Part of the problem seems to be a lack of understanding. Someone who isn\u2019t a mathematician may find maths completely rigid and unmalleable, while I\u2019ve heard of physicists describe an equation as \u201cbeautiful\u201d or \u201celegant\u201d (Maia begins to retch uncontrollably) which are adjectives you\u2019d usually associate with art or music. ANYWAY, so what made you go on to choose psychology?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>M: <\/strong>I\u2019ve always wanted to be a doctor, but when I did those psychology modules in my final year I can honestly say that I\u2019ve never enjoyed learning as much as I did then. It didn\u2019t feel like a chore, I was looking forward to revision\u2026 it was almost like a flow state, everything was just piecing together perfectly. I thought \u201cI can understand this, I like this, this is probably what I\u2019m meant to do\u201d and not gonna lie, people (mostly men) seem to come to me for free therapy anyway, maybe I should get paid for it! I\u2019m not completely sure what area I want to go into, but I\u2019m angling towards clinical psychology, neuropsychology or forensic psychology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>N: <\/strong>What does being a forensic psychologist actually entail?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>M: <\/strong>So forensic psychology would be working within the criminal justice system, working with prisoners or people in the community with records. You could be an expert witness in a court case, that sort of thing. To be honest its very complex and I\u2019m not sure I completely understand it all! Essentially the common theme is crime.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large collapse-below-left\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"711\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/maia2-1-711x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1514\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/maia2-1-711x1024.jpg 711w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/maia2-1-768x1106.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/maia2-1.jpg 854w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 711px) 100vw, 711px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>Neuropsychology focuses on people with traumatic brain injuries, Parkinsons and sometimes learning disabilities and autism. You have to know everything, neuropsychology is a post-doc qualification, as with forensic. You first have to train as a clinical psychologist, it\u2019s a long road.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>N: <\/strong>Do you know where you may want to apply to?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>M: <\/strong>I\u2019ve been thinking of another city apart from London. I really love Manchester, I considered Cambridge but then thought \u201cdo I really want to be at a place where someone\u2019s trying to arrest me just for walking into the psychology building?!\u201d. That sounds crazy but it literally happens to professors, I just think that\u2019s another level which I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>N: <\/strong>So when considering what to do in your career (where to go, what to do), do you think your race can be a deciding factor?<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>M: <\/strong>Yes definitely. I know that sometimes you just have to think \u201cfuck this\u201d and go anyway, but some of the experiences that I, and other people have had in academia have made me think it\u2019s just not worth choosing certain places just because of their credentials. Three years is a long time, and an education is a holistic experience, if one aspect of that isn\u2019t brilliant&#8230;. do I want to be there? If no one can really relate to your life experience, how are you really going to connect with anyone there?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s heart-breaking because it means there are all these missed opportunities and it\u2019s not something other people would ever have to think about. The other side of the coin is then being offered opportunities because you are black. All these job descriptions that say \u201cwe especially encourage you to apply if you are black\u201d and my parents saying \u201cwith the recent protests and the death of George Floyd, you\u2019ll probably be straight in there!\u201d. I don\u2019t want to be a statistic, I want to be hired because you like me and my unique perspective, not just to fulfill your diversity quota. Plus, just hiring black people doesn\u2019t mean your getting rid of racism in your workplace, its still there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>N: <\/strong>Could you not argue that having positive discrimination and affirmative action is a necessary steppingstone to level-out the playing field?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>M: <\/strong>That\u2019s also true, I think the work doesn\u2019t stop with just hiring people. You have to continue to actively combat the stereotypes that are within everyone and the workplace.It\u2019s something that I think about a lot, especially when considering my thesis this year. I really need quantitative experimental experience as my undergrad project was literature-based, so I need more experience with&#8230;(retches again)\u2026numbers. I want to do something really scientific and experimental. But I then I feel I have a duty to do something meaningful in social psychology where I\u2019m looking at race. So much of the literature within psychological science is about risk, negative things to do with black people involving racism and stereotypes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns collapse-above-right\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>I just want to be able to be a black person, doing research about black people that isn\u2019t negative. Of course all of it is incredibly important but having to constantly learn about only these things takes its toll. We have had lectures this year on prejudice and discrimination, I\u2019m listening to a lecturer discuss a case study where white people were more likely to be saved from a fire, then its swiftly on to another horrific example of racism. This is my life, it\u2019s me who is less likely to be saved from a burning building.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In psychology it seems that a lot of the clinical work is mainly done by white women, while the research is generally white men. I don\u2019t know how I feel about that, do I think I can fit in these practices or institutions? One of my black friends who also did psychology at university opted out of continuing, even though she was the perfect candidate. When I asked her why she didn\u2019t carry on, she said it was because the field was \u201ctoo white\u201d \u2026. and now she\u2019s doing something in HR. It hurts that she felt like she couldn\u2019t go on, even though she\u2019s incredibly gifted.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/maia4-682x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1505\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/maia4-682x1024.jpg 682w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/maia4.jpg 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Diversity in psychology is a long-acknowledged issue, with cultural differences between doctor and patient preventing a true understanding of a person\u2019s individual issues and needs.
