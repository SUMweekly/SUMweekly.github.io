At times of conflict, where is devastation there is always hope and even rebirth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The imagery in <em>How You Fall Doesn\u2019t Matter <\/em>is based of photos of the Second World War, pictures were deconstructed, and fragments were combined with new elements of my invention to create an original composition. The piece does not intend to be a representation of WW2, but an image depicting the destruction brought upon by all conflicts, aiming at prompting a reflection on how history repeat itself, but also about what we can learn from it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea of lightness and weight has been intertwined in the process of making this painting. During this process I drew parallels to the concept of lightness as discussed by the writer Italo Calvino in <em>Six Memos for the Next Millennium <\/em>(1985- 86), as the quality that literature searches in order to present life bearable without denying the weight of living. The writer uses mythology, Perseus and the head of Medusa, to illustrate this control of lightness and weight: \u2018Perseus masters that terrible face by keeping it hidden, just as he had earlier defeated it by looking at its reflection. In each case his power derives from refusing to look directly while not denying the reality of the world of monsters in which he must live, a reality he carries with him and bears as his personal burden.\u2019 Similarly, I intended to visually diminish or almost hide the power and violence of scenes of destruction and war, while asserting their reality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"footer\"> \nToo keep up with Karl&#8217;s work, follow him on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/karl_hagan\/\" data-type=\"URL\">Instagam<\/a>.<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div id=spanwrap> My paintings are often rooted in history and considerations about the times we live in<span id=span1> &#8230;<\/span><span id=span2>, and about present conflicts in particular.
