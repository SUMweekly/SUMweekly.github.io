It expresses the struggles of his past and how he tries to navigate relocating to France, whilst bearing the weight of being undocumented. The film finds a balance between the weighted emotions of Mamadou&#8217;s life, whilst finding small moments of solace in his love of dance as a form of self-expression. We sat down with the director Lo\u00efc Phil to discuss the work behind the moving film.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noah: So tell me about DJAO. How did you go about making it, how did this start?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lo\u00efc: The original idea was to make some nice soft thing and I didn&#8217;t have many ideas. I wanted to make something about dance actually. I also had a friend of mine who was a part of an association whose goal is to build a network, linking people, a solidarity network. So the idea is if you are poor, or maybe a migrant, you don&#8217;t have commitments, life is hard&#8230; but it will be a lot easier if you have all your people around to help you. Even just a friend or people to advise you. The goal was to make solidarity among people. I asked if maybe we could make a documentary mixing dance and migration. So she told me that they had a workshop and they had made a show where migrants were dancing. There was one guy, Mamadou, I learned that he could dance and he had kind of a weird energy. So she gave me his contact and then we met and we talked. And then we decided to make the documentary.  It was really supposed to be more linked to dance you know? Like half dancing and the rest was supposed to be around migration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>N: And so then it morphed into more of a study about this particular person?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>L: Yeah. So basically what happened is, so first it&#8217;s a stupid thing, but I think it it had lots of impact on the film. The first thing is that, during this period, there were lots of big strikes in France, where all the transportation was closed and then everything else was closed, so it was a shitty moment to organise parties for dancing. No-one was going to the parties because there was no buses or transportation. So that removed slightly the dancing part. The other thing that happened was, when we started to talk about the film he was waiting for his documents. And when you are waiting for the documents, you have paper documents that says you are illegal. At the middle of the pre-production his documents weren&#8217;t sorted, so he started to be defined as undocumented. So what started as &#8220;He can move wherever he wants&#8221;, &#8220;He can do whatever he wants&#8221;  turned to be &#8220;oh shit, we are stuck and we cannot move in the same way&#8221;, he couldn&#8217;t go out of the house. He was really scared of meeting the police. And so, it changed form, the shape of the film.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last thing was, we met four or five times three, we drank coffee and he told me about his life, it was really intense and there was lots of things you can&#8217;t even imagine because he has such a crazy story. His history was way more important and way more powerful than just a dance, even if I wanted to make dance film, I couldn&#8217;t. The first time I saw him dance was during the shooting of the film. So naturally the dance came out and his history was in the movement, that&#8217;s how it happened.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>N: Although you said it didn&#8217;t become a dance film, for me the the part of the film which triggered the most emotion was actually the dancing, like when they go to the club and listen to Ivorian music. That was the bit that really hit me. I think what was cool was that a lot of films are about a migrants pain and the struggle and they never show how they can still enjoy themselves, still have reasonable life where you can have fun and dance and drink. I thought that was a really powerful moment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>L: Thank you, that&#8217;s great. I think the topic of the film is not even about migration, it&#8217;s like a sub topic. The real topic is you&#8217;re carrying stuff, you know bad stuff, everyone has shitty experiences, sadness.. pain.. maybe your girlfriend broken up with you, maybe something happened to your family. Everyone carries something you know? We are all doing things&#8230; to escape. And so the story of Mamadou is the story of a guy who is trying to be released from some shitty things in his life and is trying to create steps, trying to move past times where he was stuck. Sometimes when we spoke you could tell his mind drifted to his past. So he is moving away from his past you know, from what is bad in his life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dance was the link, the bridge between pure presence and home. When you dance, you are present, you are drawing the present moment and you are living it fully &#8211; and at the same moment, for him, dance was representing his native country, listening to Ivorian music, he was thinking about his origin and not in a negative way, not about the police, murder or of his migration. He was thinking about his nature and simply enjoying it. The purity of his home, not just the bad memories.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>N: That&#8217;s such a good point. Even listening to you explain it to me makes me already see it in a new light. How long did the film take to make, what was the process of that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>L: So as I said there were the strikes in France. Things were kind of slow, the pace and the progression of the film. Instead of just seeing him in like two weeks, it took us like maybe a month and a half to talk, because it was all so slow in France. I had to cycle an hour to go see him and yeah, at the same time he was kind of scared. A big stress was when he found that he couldn&#8217;t have his documents. There was maybe three weeks where he was not really talking to me, was super afraid to go out. He was speaking about going back to Ivory Coast&#8230;it was super, super hard for him. So, yeah, I would say two, two or three months of progression. And then, it was, three days of shooting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>N: Are you still speaking to Mamadou? Are you still in contact?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>L: Yeah! We still talk to each other&#8230; on my phone sometimes I call him and stuff, but it&#8217;s difficult right now because everything is closed in France, so we have nowhere to meet. We had to talk a lot before the film, to get him comfortable and confident because it was a big film set. I wanted him to forget the camera.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>N: Well congratulations it really worked, I thought you would&#8217;ve spent a lot longer than you did shooting, for him to be that comfortable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>L: To create that we had to go to lots of places, maybe one hour in one place, then move on&#8230;. to give the impression that it was over a longer period. So if you look at the film there is many different scenes that are super short. There were many different settings to give the feel that it was a long time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> The last thing I just wanted to say with DJAO&#8230; it was just super important to involve Mamadou, we can&#8217;t do these kind of films without that. If you want people to be be intimate with you, if you want people to give you access to some places, if you want to be people to be comfortable with you and to make the film, you have to make them the centre of the creative process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>N: So were you incorporating his ideas and opinions throughout?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>L: Exactly, from the beginning the contract was &#8220;WE are making a film together&#8221;. So it&#8217;s your film. I&#8217;m just putting it into my city, my point of view of you, but it&#8217;s yours, your film. I think it&#8217;s super important to do that because if I didn&#8217;t do that, it&#8217;s just one random guy filming another guy with my subjectivity. If you give them ownership, people will get more involved and give you access to their real life and won&#8217;t play a role. So now I&#8217;m just a tool, you know. I think it was important for this part of the creative process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"footer\"> \nTo keep up with Lo\u00efc&#8217;s work, follow their<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/loicphil_\/\" data-type=\"URL\"> Instagram<\/a>.<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div id=spanwrap> DJAO is a poignant short film depicting the life of a young migrant from the Ivory Coast named <span id=span1> ..<\/span><span id=span2> Mamadou.
