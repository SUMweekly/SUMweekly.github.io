His latest album \u2018Dedicated to Those Who\u2019 was released in conjunction with a film that explores the relation between community, revolution and artistry while highlighting the uniqueness and vibrancy of a city in danger of losing its soul.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p><strong>Where did the idea for this project come from? Did you always plan to release the album together with the short film?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project was always going to be attached to some visual elements, \u2018Dedicated to those who\u2019was a concept I thought of around 3 years ago. The beats I originally made didn\u2019t make the final cut and instead were released on earlier projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My first thought was to shoot three separate videos for the beats on the album, then the director <a href=\"https:\/\/www.julesretzlaff.com\/\">Jules Retzlaff<\/a> had the idea to put the whole thing together into a movie.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"480\" height=\"476\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/bagheadhi2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4225\"\/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The film explores the uniqueness and vibrancy of the SF community, how has it felt to see your city change over the years due to gentrification?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Watching San Francisco change over the years has been heart-breaking\u2026 but it\u2019s also provided the passion and fire up our ass to speak up about the changes we see here. We felt that if we created a film that exposes the cruelty and lack of care for the people of San Francisco, while celebrating the beauty of the city that lies beneath all this tech and big money\u2026 we felt like that we could leave something that gives a visual experience, a way to feel our city.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it sucks!&nbsp; It sucks to see our city change the way it has, but it\u2019s good to recognise that even amongst these crazy changes and all the displacement there\u2019s something beautiful here. It means a lot and is very powerful\u2026regardless of how much we\u2019ve lost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You say SF can be more Zuckerberg\u2019s city than the People\u2019s city, have you seen any resistance to the growing conformity and elitism in your town?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s been a TON of resistance in the past few years. There was the <a href=\"https:\/\/eastbayexpress.com\/from-frisco-5-to-frisco-500-equiptos-hunger-strike-is-galvanizing-a-movement-against-police-brutality-2-1\/\">Frisco 500<\/a> which is a movement against police brutality sparked by the killing of Mario Woods and the general treatment of people of colour at the hands of the SFPD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;There\u2019s also been a lot of work against gentrification, such as anti-displacement and anti-eviction movements. There\u2019s community work being done to help feed families which can\u2019t afford the rising costs of living in an expensive city\u2026. Folks like <a href=\"https:\/\/missionmealscoalition.org\/\">Mission Meals<\/a><strong> <\/strong>and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.podersf.org\/\">Poder<\/a> who are either feeding people or creating spaces where people can grow their own gardens etcetera. So yeah there\u2019s a lot of community work going down in the city that stands against the corporate greed that blankets our city.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your music reminds me of the chop-god <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-Sg-O6N0vfI\">Knxwledge<\/a> and other sampling greats, who were your influences when developing your style?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah I guess I\u2019m kind of a walking clich\u00e9 in that sense. Knxwledge is one of my biggest influences\u2026 Madlib, J-Dilla. Early on when I first really got into hip-hop my top 5 was J-Dilla, Madlib, MF DOOM, RZA and Pete Rock. Nowadays I still love those folks but as you say I\u2019m heavily influenced by Kxnwledge. I listen to a lot of Earl Sweatshirt and Mick Jenkins, that kind of Trap-Soul but still very sample heavy Hip-Hop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who would you love to work with inside and outside of your genre?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first goal is to make the artists that I work with become the artists that musicians I would respond to this question with. My folks like Professor Gable, MC Paws, A1\u2026 there\u2019s so many artists that I work with, and those are the people I look up to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at more established artists, I\u2019d love to work with Larry June, Freddie Gibbs, Earl Sweatshirt<strong>. <\/strong>Outside of my genre people like <strong>SIR<\/strong> or <strong>Blast<\/strong>\u2026 soul and R&amp;B kind of guys. I\u2019d also love to score films, I like putting music to visuals, putting my beats behind a video.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s your process when working on a project?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I usually lead with the name, <strong>\u2018Dedicated to Those Who\u2019<\/strong> was a concept I thought of, and as I picked the name I tried to go deeper into what that name meant for me. From there I look through what I have, I\u2019m always making new music and I\u2019m always trying to bring my best music to a project, while using tracks that make the most sense in the concept that I\u2019ve built. So I just sit there for days picking and choosing beats\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ll sit there and find all those things that make sense to me inside of the album\u2026 cutting and pasting where they should go, arranging all of these little pieces, kind of like creating a film. I\u2019m influenced by albums like Madvillianyand Pi\u00f1ata, albums which feel like a film to me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are you plans for the future, any new projects coming up?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve got a lot of artists that I\u2019m working with at the moment\u2026. me and A1 just released <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1SskbQhV0Ac\">a single <\/a>with more music on the way. And there are other artists which I don\u2019t wanna jinx just yet!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"640\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ab67616d0000b273f4c0a1d48599a3b7d49ab239.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4227\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ab67616d0000b273f4c0a1d48599a3b7d49ab239.jpg 640w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ab67616d0000b273f4c0a1d48599a3b7d49ab239-200x200.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<div id=\"artistlinkwrap\" class=\"marginbottom\">\n<div id=\"artistlink\">\n  <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/album\/7K0fbfpLY5pAHEpeufulJB\" data-type=\"URL\" class=\"muslink spotify\"><div id=\"muslinktext\">Spotify<\/div><\/a>\n  <a href=\"https:\/\/music.apple.com\/ca\/album\/dedicated-to-those-who\/1545287808\" data-type=\"URL\" class=\"muslink apple\"><div id=\"muslinktext\">Apple Music<\/div><\/a>\n  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.deezer.com\/en\/album\/193907252\" data-type=\"URL\" class=\"muslink deezer\"><div id=\"muslinktext\">Deezer<\/div><\/a>\n  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iBt7_5_-qLY&amp;list=OLAK5uy_ms5cVshDnnwVD-mJ9YJPlu0V9B5rlzrxc\" data-type=\"URL\" class=\"muslink youtube\"><div id=\"muslinktext\">Youtube<\/div><\/a>\n  <a href=\"https:\/\/music.amazon.com\/albums\/B08QTSRVM2?do=play&amp;ref=dm_ws_dp_ald_bb_phfa_xx_xx_xx\" data-type=\"URL\" class=\"muslink amazon\"><div id=\"muslinktext\">Amazon<\/div><\/a>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"footer\"> \nTo keep up with Baghead&#8217;s work, you can follow him on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/baghead.osk\/\" data-type=\"URL\">Instagram<\/a>.\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div id=spanwrap> Hailing from San Francisco, Baghead is young producer whos beats and compositions create<span id=span1> &#8230;<\/span><span id=span2>soundscapes reminiscent of the sampling gods.
