Racism and the historical medical mistreatment of Black bodies have upheld ideas of Blackness as not only culturally other but humanly other altogether.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Black people experience higher levels of neglect and mistreatment by medical professionals, are haunted by erroneous anatomical beliefs fabricated by racists that still find their way into medical practice today, and, to make this game even more despicable, are put at increased health risk by the very same racism that makes seeking out healthcare so much harder for us.Black people know this, and medicine\u2019s bright white history has left many mistrustful. So many of us are always ready for the potential awkwardness from the receptionist when we ask \u201cdo you have any Black doctors available?\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"564\" height=\"794\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/j.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4041\"\/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>It shouldn\u2019t be surprising that Black folks face discrimination and neglect when it comes to health services. The history of western medicine is white, male and riddled with atrocities committed on Black bodies. And the legacy of this history, as with all institutions in society, is still very much alive, still perpetuating the racism that\u2019s been inherent in medicine since the colonisers colonised. There isn\u2019t sufficient knowledge among healthcare workers in diseases like sickle cell, which predominantly affects those of African and Caribbean descent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"782\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ohno2-782x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3965\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ohno2-782x1024.jpg 782w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ohno2-768x1006.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ohno2.jpg 1063w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>Medical schools aren\u2019t training doctors to know how some illnesses present in people with Black skin, with some doctors going through their entire training without seeing examples of how common skin conditions like eczema appear on non-white skin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One that\u2019s been headlining recently is how pulse oximeters are more likely to miss low levels of oxygen in people with Black skin, resulting in Black patients being sent home when they should be hospitalised. \u201cHistorically medical education was designed and written by white middle-class men, and so there is an inherent racism in medicine that means it exists to serve white patients above all others,\u201d leaving Black patients subjected to higher levels of neglect, mistreatment and death.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>A recent and tragic case involving a sickle cell patient is that of Evan Smith, who died after calling 999 from inside the hospital when he was denied oxygen after being told his blood saturation levels were healthy. The coroner ruled that the cause of Smith\u2019s death was not receiving \u201ca timely exchange transfusion\u201d. A significant factor in the delay was \u201ca lack of understanding of sickle cell disease in the medical and nursing staff looking after Mr Smith.\u201d An alarming finding was that \u201cnurses did not have specific training in managing sickle cell disease, despite serving an area with a large African and Caribbean community.\u201d The coroner did not make a ruling of neglect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a case at my local hospital, also in an area with a large population of African and Caribbean people, where a woman took herself with her new-born to A&amp;E and was sent home by hospital staff on a bus. It turned out she had developed sepsis a week after giving birth. A Black nurse who later heard about this said she immediately knew the woman was Black because such treatment was so commonplace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>Black people are mistreated and under-served in healthcare. This is a direct result of medicine\u2019s racist history, for which not enough has been done to undo, and the subsequent implicit biases held by medical professionals and healthcare workers. As recently as the 1970s there were medical text books that stated Black people have a higher pain threshold than whites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as recently as 2016 a study from the United States found that many medical students \u201cbelieved that black people\u2019s nerve endings are less sensitive than white people and that black people\u2019s blood coagulates quicker.\u201d <\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"881\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/parasumtamol7-881x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4072\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/parasumtamol7-881x1024.jpg 881w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/parasumtamol7-768x893.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/parasumtamol7-1322x1536.jpg 1322w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/parasumtamol7-1320x1534.jpg 1320w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/parasumtamol7.jpg 1516w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 881px) 100vw, 881px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been other studies showing that \u201cblack patients are often prescribed less pain relief than other people, despite having the same conditions, and that applies to children too.\u201d There are countless cases of Black patients being denied the care they need and are entitled to or having to fight a lot harder to receive it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was hard not to think about my own experiences and those of people close to me as I went through these stories of mistreatment and learnt even more about how deeply race impacted medicine and healthcare provision. When I hear that there are medical workers out there who think our blood coagulates quicker I can\u2019t help wonder about a time I went to A&amp;E and instead of leaving with stitches I got a dodgy tape up that had reopened by the time I got home. I had to buy my own supplies and take care of the dressing myself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"884\" height=\"758\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pelwis8ioho.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4046\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pelwis8ioho.jpg 884w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pelwis8ioho-768x659.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 884px) 100vw, 884px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>When I hear that our pain is perceived differently I can\u2019t help think about the time when a doctor wouldn\u2019t prescribe me pain medication for migraines. Maybe the hospital staff there were bad at their jobs, maybe it was an accident. Maybe that doctor genuinely thought I\u2019d be fine if I watched my caffeine intake and tried to take paracetamol as early on as possible. The fact is I can\u2019t not wonder if race played a part in these events. Especially when stories of Black people being treated differently are so widespread and seen in all areas of healthcare.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>An area that\u2019s been receiving particular attention recently, also with a long history of neglecting Black people, is mental health care. In school, I saw white students getting access to services and being treated with more sympathy than my Black peers and myself. Even once in the system I\u2019ve had friends report also feeling gaslit and treated with blatant disregard at points. Medication reviews feel one sided, symptoms are questioned and ignored, problematic behaviours are minimised.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Race can even make it hard to take the first steps in seeking out mental health services. Or, rather, the lack of provision within mental health services of sufficient resources for Black patients, such as POC therapists, can make this hard. \u201cI would take anything right now not to feel the way that I did last night because it was awful,\u201d a friend said to me, \u201cand I know that I need therapy but I am not willing to go to a white therapist at this point in time.\u201d Similarly to how a female assault victim would rather see a female therapist, a Black person who has been psychologically impacted by the frequent traumas of racism would rather see a Black therapist to discuss these things. The fact that healthcare services don\u2019t think about this shows they don\u2019t think about Black patients and their experiences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know these are services that are already strained but when Blackness is such a common denominator among those let down by them it\u2019s impossible not to look at race as part of the reason for these failings. The recent deaths of Olisa Odukwe and Richard Okorogheye serve as yet more tragic reminders that while Black folks are let down in all areas of healthcare, mental health is one which seems to particularly fail and exclude us time and time again. In the words of @lookingformothermax, \u201cyoung Black people\u2019s lives should not be cut short before they are afforded access to, and inclusivity in facilities and services\u2026 the face of mental health advocacy and campaigning should not and cannot only be white middle-class people.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The health disparities highlighted by Covid-19 won\u2019t be going away once the pandemic is over (nor did they only come to exist when it started), and if negative health outcomes resulting from racial bias aren\u2019t spoken about they never will. We need more research into how race impacts health outcomes. Data needs to be gathered so problems and solutions can be identified. As long as the experiences of Black people are ignored and gaslit by society and by documents like the Sewell Report, they\u2019ll be ignored and gaslit by our doctors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/uteri-1024x658.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4013\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/uteri-1024x658.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/uteri-768x493.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/uteri-1536x986.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/uteri-1320x848.jpg 1320w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/uteri.jpg 1601w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And for those who lack certain levels of humanity and need these issues framed in the context of how wider society is affected for them to mean anything to you, vaccine hesitancy among BAME communities is a direct result of the mistrust these groups have of the medical establishment because of its racist past and present.
