His work is not confined to any single mode, style or technique, instead being characterised by the expression that emanates from everything he creates. Samuel is involved in a number of different projects built out of his DIY approach, including Quantum Couriers, The New Earth Art School and The Lurner Prize. Stepping outside of the norms and systems presented to us in order to construct new, more open ways of solving problems, interacting with one another and expressing ourselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"borderbottom\">Samuel spoke to us about a range of topics, giving insight on everything from his creative process, to the joys of interacting with the people he meets during his free courier service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"footer\" class=\"marginbottom\"> \nTo keep up with Samuel&#8217;s art, sign up to his newsletter by emailing him at <a href=\"mailto:beg4cred@gmail.com\" data-type=\"URL\">beg4cred@gmail.com<\/a>, or follow him on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/beg4cred\" data-type=\"URL\">Instagram<\/a>.

I was encouraged to draw, paint, things like that. I got really inspired by the impressionists. I remember being taken to see an exhibition and seeing Monet in particular made me want to create something that has that kind of power, and I never really stopped you know?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">J:<\/span> Yeah definitely, I was gonna say that you very quite prolific in your output\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">S:<\/span> Very much so, I see making art as being integral to my life as anything else. It\u2019s just something that I do, the same way I eat every day I make art every day and it\u2019s been that way for quite a few years. It\u2019s a natural thing for me to live creatively and I always think about making stuff, I don\u2019t really separate my art from the rest of my life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">J:<\/span> I was wondering if you had any core philosophies or ways you approach making art?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">S:<\/span> I suppose there\u2019s lots of ways to come at this question. I approach art as a natural part of my everyday life, I think art is a way of learning about myself, and a form of therapy. It\u2019s a process of self-realisation, I make art because I\u2019m trying to express myself and through that process of self-expression you are able to learn who you are, I think that\u2019s important. I have very firm beliefs in the idea that all of us are essentially creative beings and that\u2019s something I strive to embody every day, to be a creator in every moment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">J:<\/span> It seems that you don\u2019t really limit yourself in modes of expression and the mediums you use, that you approach art in a lot of different ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">S:<\/span> I just like making stuff, I\u2019m not really interested in any kind of definition of what I\u2019m doing. One day I might decide to write a poem, well actually one hour I might be writing a poem and the next I might a song. It\u2019s all expression, I feel like I\u2019ve got a lot to give and it\u2019s difficult to just pick one mode to do that, I just feel very free in trying everything and I love it.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">J:<\/span> It seems that some of your pieces must have taken a while to make, while some look like they could have taken seconds\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">S:<\/span> That relates to what I was saying about trying lots of different things. There are times when I feel like I want that meditative feeling and do a really involved, incredibly detailed pen and ink drawing, and then some days there\u2019s more of a feeling of wanting to do things quickly and just get them out there.<br>I say that but there both meditative for me in different kind of ways, Its just based on how I feel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">J:<\/span> In terms of influences, do you have any others that come to mind ?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">S:<\/span> I\u2019m inspired in lots of different ways by lots of different people, artists like Monet and Picasso\u2026.. recently artists like <strong>Hilma af Klint<\/strong>, who was a real foundational artist that didn\u2019t get the credit she deserved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way I approach art is definitely inspired by musicians I admire too. I loved Hip-hop growing up and the DIY entrepreneurial spirit of it has always inspired me. The way that a lot of rappers would just create their own brand and become successful by themselves&#8230; that classic image of people selling CDs out of the back of their car, that really inspires me and is the way I want to sell my art, it\u2019s almost like a hustler approach to art. It suits me as I make so much; I\u2019ve got all this product. In terms of trying to make a living as an artist, its helpful to me to have that kind of inspiration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The actual artistic style that I have is clearly inspired by the great artist of the 20<sup>th<\/sup> century and I feel like that\u2019s really ingrained in my work. Then in more recent years as I\u2019ve tried to get my work out into the world I\u2019ve started to take inspiration from people who aren\u2019t necessarily artists, people who have found a way to make their mark on culture, which is something I\u2019ve really wanted to do. I feel really passionate about bringing the work I do into a mainstream context. I feel like the ideas that I represent have been on the fringes for too long, I don\u2019t embrace the term \u201cOutsider art\u201d as I want to be a mainstream artist, but without having to compromise anything important and bring that philosophy in front of more people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">J:<\/span> Could you talk about your project <em>Quantum Couriers <\/em>? How did you come with the idea for that? I imagine its kind of close to the philosophy of putting out ideas by embodying them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">S:<\/span> Its all one thing really. I\u2019ve always been into cycling, I used to be a courier and I loved cycling around the city and meeting people. Being in that environment and contributing to that environment in the form of street art\u2026 although the job itself was quite brutal and I did feel like I was exploited and mistreated by the company I worked for. During the first lockdown I wanted to do something with the courier bike I still had and do something to help, and also just to get out and connect with people. So I thought id just offer this service with the bike and see if anyone needs help moving things around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I came into contact with people who were handing out food and asked if they needed help, that has now become the core thing of what I do. So at the moment I\u2019m collecting hot meals in Covent Garden and ride around, finding people who might need food and giving it out. I\u2019ve been doing it for a few months and have a regular run and have started to get to know people who I often see. I wanted to do something that I thought could be helpful to people but also something that I would enjoy. I get to have all the aspects of being in the city while contributing something that people might really need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m trying to demonstrate that you can still do things in ways that haven\u2019t been thought of before. For example I don\u2019t really consider what I do charity; I don\u2019t really like the word. Charities sometimes operate in ways which I don\u2019t really agree with, there tends to be a dynamic of the helpers and the people being helped. For me we\u2019re all the same and all equally deserving of a good life, some people are just in a difficult situation. I like to interact with people on an equal level which I think can mean a lot to people who are often looked down upon. It\u2019s important for me to demonstrate that it is worth doing things in life that aren\u2019t necessarily paid for.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div id=spanwrap> Samuel Mead (Beg4Cred) is a prolific artist, who lives and breathes creativity.
