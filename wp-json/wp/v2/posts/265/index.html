These are the images that big conservation&nbsp;organisations&nbsp;show us in order to get money out of our wallets and into their bank accounts.&nbsp;Although&nbsp;scientific evidence supporting&nbsp;much of their conservation&nbsp;work&nbsp;is somewhat lacking,&nbsp;their marketing is spot on. The&nbsp;world\u2019s&nbsp;biggest conservation&nbsp;organisation, for example, is now worth $6.5 billion.&nbsp;Academics have voiced their concerns over&nbsp;conservationists&nbsp;primary focus shifting from preserving biodiversity, to acquiring funding; regardless, they continue to grow.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poaching is one key area&nbsp;conservationists&nbsp;are focusing on. The \u2018poaching crisis\u2019 is&nbsp;affecting&nbsp;species globally &#8211; but&nbsp;particularly&nbsp;in&nbsp;sub-Saharan Africa,&nbsp;black&nbsp;rhinos, which&nbsp;have dwindled from millions to thousands&nbsp;in the past century.&nbsp;The driving force behind the unprecedented increase in poaching is the&nbsp;ever-expanding illegal wildlife trade. At&nbsp;$65,000 per kilogram, rhino horn is worth more than both gold and heroin on the Vietnamese black market.&nbsp;Organised criminals&nbsp;have responded accordingly and&nbsp;are now&nbsp;using&nbsp;novel techniques to capture and traffic wildlife&nbsp;to the&nbsp;region.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"817\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/pleftfinal7-817x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-553\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/pleftfinal7-817x1024.jpg 817w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/pleftfinal7-768x962.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/pleftfinal7-1226x1536.jpg 1226w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/pleftfinal7-1634x2048.jpg 1634w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/pleftfinal7.jpg 1987w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>So, what\u2019s the best solution we have&nbsp;to curb the wildlife trade? Green&nbsp;militarisation. This involves arming park rangers, increasing military style surveillance, and incorporating AI and global communications systems into park security. If this all sounds quite dramatic, that\u2019s because it is. In Kruger National Park, South Africa, the rhino poaching crisis reached a tipping point in 2012. An increase from 13 rhinos killed in 2008 to over 1200 in 2012 provoked a reaction from South Africa.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former Major General&nbsp;Johan&nbsp;Jooste&nbsp;was appointed to the position of anti-poaching coordinator in 2012. Jooste\u2019s&nbsp;long history in the armed forces and critical \u2013 if troubling \u2013 role in the&nbsp;\u2018apartheid&nbsp;wars\u2019 secured him the role. His anti-poaching mantra was obvious from the outset: violence first, negotiation later.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>Jooste&nbsp;quickly&nbsp;bolstered&nbsp;defences and&nbsp;framed poaching as&nbsp;\u201ca declaration of war against South Africa by armed foreign criminals\u201d. Fences were erected, armed rangers were&nbsp;employed&nbsp;and surveillance planes scrambled.&nbsp;Ex-veterans from&nbsp;the global north flocked to the country to scratch their violent itch&nbsp;under the guise of&nbsp;conservation work.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Across the border in Mozambique, large tracts of land adjacent to Kruger National Park began to be bought or leased by South African businesses, foreign NGO\u2019s, nation-states (Germany, the Netherlands, South Africa) and philanthropists. A new national park, the Greater Lebombo Conservancy, was created and swiftly militarised. Those who lived within this area, roughly the size of Dorset, where forcibly relocated to its borders, and subsistence hunting was outlawed. These people now join the 1 million+ other victims of biodiversity protection as \u2018conservation refugees\u2019. The park would act as a \u2018buffer\u2019 to the Kruger Park, discouraging Mozambicans from poaching and extending South Africa\u2019s power beyond its borders. <\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"638\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/finalrightcrop3-1-638x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-549\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/finalrightcrop3-1-638x1024.jpg 638w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/finalrightcrop3-1-768x1233.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/finalrightcrop3-1-957x1536.jpg 957w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/finalrightcrop3-1-1276x2048.jpg 1276w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/finalrightcrop3-1.jpg 1551w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite this mega-militarisation, the year following Jooste\u2019s appointment saw a record-breaking number of rhinos killed and de-horned within Kruger Park. The consequences, however, were not restricted to the animal kingdom. Since the Lebombo Conservancy was created in 2012, over 300 (suspected) poachers have been killed. This forces us to question how effective \u2018green&nbsp;militarisation\u2019 really is, and raises some poignant moral dilemmas: is a rhino\u2019s life, or the assurance of a rhino\u2019s life, worth more than a human\u2019s? Why is wildlife more valuable than human life in Africa, but not in the UK or the global north more generally? Perhaps it\u2019s because we don\u2019t have any spectacular wildlife worth protecting. Or, is it because poaching is a&nbsp;racialised&nbsp;crime in Africa, that a legacy of colonialism facilitates?&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, poaching rhinos is legal in South Africa for those rich white men who can afford the hunting licenses. The fatal consequences for some, and simple monetary exchange for others, is seen as cultural imperialism at its best, and a new form of colonialism at worst. Perhaps next time&nbsp;you see the rhino advert on TV you will question the agenda more critically. Are we saving rhinos, or are we exercising control comparable to that of colonists just 120 years ago?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"footer\"> \nWriting by\n<a href=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/?tag=dillon-creedon\" data-type=\"URL\">Dillon Creedon<\/a> and illustrations by\n<a href=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/?tag=james-farrant\" data-type=\"URL\">James Farrant<\/a>.\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div id=spanwrap> If you have ever seen a conservation advert on TV, chances are<span id=span1> &#8230;<\/span><span id=span2> it was either of a cute panda, a sad donkey or a rhino with its horn cut off<span id=span3> &#8230;<\/span><span id=span4>.
