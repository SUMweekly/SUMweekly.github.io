She spoke to SUM about her experiences in the commercial design industry and how she uses her art to understand and reflect the many cultures she has experienced in her path as an artist.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>Fiona:&nbsp;I\u2019d call myself a multimedia artist\u2026which is kind of a basic explanation, but maybe with a focus on design? My work revolves around belonging, heritage and race. I\u2019m trying to underline the marginalised voices of people who don\u2019t have enough say in our society.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I grew up in Brussels, my mums Austrian and my Dads Nigerian and I was raised the \u201cAustrian Way\u201d. I was never perceived as a Belgian, nor as an Austrian or Nigerian person. I always wanted to study philosophy, but I liked the artists approach to viewing the world and enjoyed experimenting with colour etc\u2026 so I thought \u201cfuck it\u201d let\u2019s be an artist. I\u2019m now doing a course on advertising and brand design; I get to explore quite a wide range of different mediums, but the focus is very commercially driven and whitewashed. The way the course educates us to fit into the white industry isn\u2019t enjoyable, but at the same time, it\u2019s helped me think critically and given me a wider experience.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/fihs2-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4155\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/fihs2-683x1024.jpg 683w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/fihs2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/fihs2-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/fihs2-1320x1980.jpg 1320w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/fihs2.jpg 1366w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I guess with advertising the primary objective is to sell stuff right?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right, and I guess I could have figured that out from the title of the course, but it was sold to me as a very creative multicultural course, however, we only focus on briefs from big white led cooperation. It feels really numbing to my creative practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So kind-of Eurocentric, finance-facing work?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exactly, we did a brief with Barclays, Giff-Gaff and so on. Very commercial and simplistic designs, every time I try to add a bit of colour I get in trouble! It\u2019s all rooted in cultural capital, and I think the way design is perceived needs to be changed, in order to give a voice to non-swiss design.&nbsp; So, I\u2019m in my last year now and am mainly focused on finishing my dissertation and my self-directed projects which I find interesting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always wanted to explore the identity and feeling of belonging of mixed-race people, as this is a demographic I can relate to. I know it\u2019s very delicate as we are holding the most privileges when compared to the rest of the Black community and of course, colourism is a huge problem. I want to make a safe space where we can explore our issues but also explore our privileges and see how we can elevate the black community rather than indulge in the mixed-race proximity to whiteness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/fihs1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4160\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/fihs1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/fihs1-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/fihs1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/fihs1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/fihs1-1320x880.jpg 1320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Can you elaborate?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first, I wanted to address every mixed-race person, but the first problem I faced is: who identifies as mixed-race? I decided to focus on the biggest mixed-race group in the UK which is Black African and White and Black West Indies and White people.&nbsp; This demographic is the one I can identify the most with. Furthermore, I realised it was a class and gender conversation, as well as where you were born and raised. Everyone has a different experience.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My focus became mixed-race femme-identifying individuals. I started organising photoshoots that are accompanied by individual interview sessions or focus groups.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After collecting the images and interviews I\u2019m then planning on putting together a zine which I will hopefully launch the next year 2022. I want this to be a safe space open for people to learn and explore, learn about each other\u2019s experiences, and find peace with one\u2019s identity living in split worlds.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>As a mix-race person, do you wish that you had a greater feeling of belonging? Or are you quite content with you dual-heritage and the fact that you have been able to experience so many different cultures and nationalities?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/fi13-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4137\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/fi13-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/fi13-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/fi13-1320x1760.jpg 1320w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/fi13.jpg 1537w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>I think there are two sides to it, and I have experienced both sides. We hold a lot of power as mixed-race individuals due to our proximity to whiteness &#8211; I think we need to be very aware of that. Our mixed skin tone helps us connect to different demographics and cultures easier. I feel like mixed-race individuals navigate the world by adapting as they will never be surrounded by the same group except for their siblings.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there is also a feeling of isolation I have experienced. As an example: When I was younger, I always felt Austrian having been raised by my Austrian single mom. Nevertheless, when experiencing racist abuse both from family members and the wider public I felt very rejected realising I will never be perceived as fully Austrian. The feeling of wanting to belong emerged and grew in me. The first time I perfectly blended in was in Morocco. A place I have no connection within terms of heritage, however a place I felt so accepted in. Nobody questioned my heritage and background, nobody asked me where I was from.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Considering your art, are you always trying to consider these issues of race and heritage in your work? Do you ever make a piece without trying to incorporate a social commentary?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think as much as I try not to be influenced by my surroundings, I am drawn to the experience of Jean Dubuffet (A post-war artist, famed for founding the \u201cArt Brut\u201d movement).  He attempted to make art that was completely separated from the context of society, but then realised it was impossible, there will always be influences in society that affect how you create a piece of art. Because I think about identity and race so much, it\u2019s impossible to stop them from influencing my work. It might be a phase, my work used to be a lot about capitalism and our superficial society, so who knows what\u2019s next. Whatever needs focus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I know you call yourself a multimedia artist, which seems to be a very common thing these days, but what\u2019s your preferred medium?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>I love oil pastels, fine liners, and pencils. After I create a piece, I usually photograph the piece and then use things like photoshop to change the piece into something else, so the finished product is usually a print. I do have original works, but I feel like the power of erasing, merging, cutting out and copying does help on a digital device.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How do you marry your interests in industry and design with your work as an artist? Is the end goal to be an entirely self-sufficient artist without needing to do any commercial work?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I\u2019m, still learning, building, and figuring out what I want to do. It would be ideal to have my art and my style as an artist serve as the main source of income. By receiving commissions who ask for my art style, my hope grows that I could become a successful artist. Ideally, I\u2019d like to scrap all the commercial work as it just fulfils the need for money. My main goal is to collaborate with people that share similar values to mine.  <\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/fi14-2-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4167\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/fi14-2-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/fi14-2-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/fi14-2-1320x1760.jpg 1320w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/fi14-2.jpg 1537w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What kind of projects do you have coming up?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a volunteer for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/yeoja_mag\/\">Yeoja Magazine<\/a>, which is an intersectional Berlin-based feminist magazine.
