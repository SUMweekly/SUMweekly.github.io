I focused on neuroimaging for one third of my degree, which is a class of techniques to get images of the brain. There\u2019s different ways to do it\u2026 most people have heard of MRI but there are loads of other ways to do it, its all super interesting stuff and I\u2019m sure it will be useful for the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So what\u2019s the plan for the future then?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For my project I\u2019m going to be analysing brain data from people who have taken LSD and DMT, and doing some machine learning analysis and computational modelling on the info.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/sum2-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3568\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/sum2-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/sum2-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/sum2-1320x1760.jpg 1320w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/sum2.jpg 1537w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully afterwards I\u2019ll find work as a research assistant and then potentially do a PhD, we\u2019ll see how things go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How did you get into neuroscience in the first place?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My bachelors was in sociology and psychology, my Uni journey is pretty jokes. I\u2019ve always been into philosophy so that was what I originally aimed to study and I originally got into UCL for it, but I was always that kid to didn\u2019t work hard enough but just coasted by and I didn\u2019t end up getting the grades to actually go there. I didn\u2019t even know what I was thinking but my sister was just like <em>\u201cStudy something..just go to Uni\u201d<\/em>, so I ended up doing a criminology course at Kent, to be honest I couldn\u2019t even tell you what criminology was about when I started there other than what the name suggests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I met a couple people at Uni who were doing psychology and it looked tempting\u2026 I had spent the summer before watching all these Darren Brown videos and thought this was what doing psychology could lead to! So I switched and when I started learning more about psychology and it\u2019s basis\u2026the Brain. By my second year I was really getting into neuroscience, reading all the popular books and decided that\u2019s what I was going to do in my life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s interesting because although my journey hasn\u2019t been very typical, every time I reach I different step in education I uncover a bit more about what I really want to do. From philosophy to philosophy of the mind to psychology to neuroscience\u2026 and now theoretical neuroscience. It was a natural progression.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yeah I feel like although they\u2019re different subjects they all lead into each other nicely. Looking at the brain\u2026 how it works, then you get into consciousness and the Hard Problem, it all makes sense.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What\u2019s messed up with our educational system though is the fact that you have to almost decided what you want to do in life when you\u2019re taking your GCSE\u2019s\u2026<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I completely agree, if you want to do a specialist subject at Uni you could have to make the decision at 16-years old!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although there are merits to the system because I was able to switch around. My A-levels were very much humanities-based and I didn\u2019t really know what science was. So I\u2019m very grateful that I was able to cross over into the world of science.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/sum3-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3567\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/sum3-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/sum3-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/sum3-1320x1760.jpg 1320w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/sum3.jpg 1537w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p><strong>I feel like that\u2019s more of a merit to you though, rather than how easy it is. I doubt the average person would be able to seamlessly switch from humanities to neuroscience. Like you said you read loads of literature and did your own research and hustle\u2026. hats off to you.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be honest I wouldn\u2019t even see it as work. That\u2019s the beauty of when you\u2019re really passionate about something, it\u2019s almost as if its not you doing the reading or you doing the work\u2026 you just <strong><em>do <\/em><\/strong>it, you\u2019re almost a passive observer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had this in an exam recently, I was just really enjoying it to the point where I was almost watching myself do it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I know what you mean, I wouldn\u2019t class doing physics as <em>work <\/em>per se. Slyly I\u2019d get enjoyment out of revising and even doing exams. Obviously if it\u2019s a hard exam and you\u2019re doing shit it\u2019s a different story\u2026. But I know that feeling.<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So what is the biggest thing you\u2019re interested in neuroscience right now?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m really into something called the Free Energy Principle. It\u2019s a <strong><em>Bayesian Brian Hypothesis <\/em><\/strong>(<em>Bayes theorem is a way of calculating conditional probability&#8230; Such as the probability of a patient having liver disease on the <strong>condition<\/strong> that they are an alcoholic<\/em>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It basically states that the way the brain is constantly updating is by using Bayes Rule, literally plugging in your prior beliefs into to this theorem to achieve a prediction. This is the most fundamental thing the brain does, from the level of <em>Am I looking at a phone right now? <\/em>To the level of <em>Should I apply for a PhD?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How would you even go about investigating something like that?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why it\u2019s such a hot topic and why some people are against it. The reason why it is true is not because of experimental evidence, it\u2019s because of it\u2019s mathematical soundness. The reason why people assume the brain is doing Bayesian inference (<em>the brain uses bayes theorem to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence comes in\u2026 eg. You see a cat, then you smell cat shit, then there\u2019s some brown stuff on your bed.. the brain will be using bayes theorem to continuously update the likelihood that said cat has shat on your bed)<\/em>, is because it\u2019s the most mathematically simple way to describe what\u2019s going on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So this is obviously a highly theoretical description of how the brain works&#8230; How does this translate into an explanation into how the brain actual <em>does <\/em>that? From my limited knowledge I know that lots of processes in the brain aren\u2019t even well understood.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This almost treats the brain as a computing machine, how does this theoretical model cope with the fact that some people are able to predict things better than other people, or variations in intelligence and understanding of the world?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way that the Bayesian inference occurs is through different synaptic connections (<em>the junctions that connect neurons, cells which use electrical impulses and chemical signals to transmit info around the brain)<\/em>. By strengthening or weakening these synaptic connections the brain updates prior information to obtain a prediction. Under this framework \u201cIntelligence\u201d would be your brain\u2019s ability to alter these connections in order to adjust your prior beliefs in the most logical way. Everyone has variations in brain anatomy, which would affect their ability to update their prior beliefs to form a sensible prediction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This could also account mental health disorders like schizophrenia, in this framework someone with schizophrenia would not have strong prior beliefs. An example would be auditory hallucinations, someone with strong prior beliefs would determine that a voice in their head is actually them, whereas someone with schizophrenia could determine that this \u201cvoice\u201d is actually someone or something else (<strong><em>N: <\/em><\/strong><em>I tried to imagine a situation where my mind is wiped. If I then saw a plane, my lack of strong prior beliefs could lead me to infer that the plane was actually a flying monster which would soon eject cats to shit on my bed)<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other side of the spectrum is something like depression, instead of the problem of not having strong prior beliefs, it\u2019s that your prior beliefs are too strong. Your depressing thoughts of worthlessness and sadness are then constraining the way you view evidence way more than the should. It\u2019s interesting because there are studies that show that depressed individuals actually have a more accurate view of reality. Now let\u2019s look at how psychedelics are used as a treatment for depression. It increases the entropy of the brain, the amount of different states a brain can be in. This means that the depressive priors are being diluted by the increase of different states, when people say the have a \u201cnew view of life\u201d after taking psychedelics, they are literally using different synaptic connections to make predictions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>That\u2019s actually mad, I\u2019ve never heard it be explained like that before. But how do you conduct boots on the ground research into this?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>For my dissertation I will be taking brain data from people taking LSD and DMT, I would then measure the entropy of the brain. Looking at the connectivity patterns between different regions of the brain, people who have taken psychedelics should have a much wider array of communication patterns between different regions, which implies that the number of micro-states the brain can be in has increased (<em>another way of saying entropy has increased)<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the beauty is that compared to other disciplines neuroscience is so young, we don\u2019t know how far we can push the theoretical side of it, we\u2019ve just started! When you compare it to theoretical physicists who can make predictions which take decades for experiments to prove (e.g. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/morning-mix\/wp\/2016\/02\/12\/einstein-predicted-gravitational-waves-100-years-ago-heres-what-it-took-to-prove-him-right\/\">Einsteins gravitational wave<\/a>), we haven\u2019t reached that stage with neuroscience yet and I\u2019m excited to see what happens.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/sum1-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3572\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/sum1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/sum1-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/sum1-1320x1760.jpg 1320w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/sum1.jpg 1537w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>But is comparing neuroscience with physics the right way? Once you get to a biological system like the brain, do we have the ability to predict and model things by boiling down to fundamental mathematics? I can use a computer to model some particles moving around in a box, but how can I model something so impossibly complex as the brain?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s like any other science, we can\u2019t see the answers until we get there, we can\u2019t compute something\u2026.until we can. If you had asked <a href=\"https:\/\/physicsworld.com\/a\/james-clerk-maxwell-a-force-for-physics\/\">James Maxwell<\/a> about Quantum Mechanics he would have been baffled! We\u2019re in a similar situation now with neuroscience, we\u2019re limited by the technology, it takes time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you don\u2019t have to go to a fine-grain approach as particles, instead you could use molecules or chemicals as the fundamental \u201cunit\u201d and just treat the brain as a chemical soup. As you said,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>sometimes it\u2019s easier to use statistical methods when faced with modelling a large collection of particles. I think with time things will get better and I feel super-interested in pursuing it, there\u2019s so much more things to learn and I can\u2019t wait<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/deji5-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3598\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/deji5-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/deji5-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/deji5-1320x1760.jpg 1320w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/deji5.jpg 1537w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p><strong>If we were eventually able to mathematical model everything that\u2019s going on in the brain, would we then be able to essentially re-create a human mind on a computer?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think there\u2019s two elements to it. There\u2019s the element of you being able to reproduce the human brain within a computer, using fundamental Axioms (established truth) which describe how the brain works.
