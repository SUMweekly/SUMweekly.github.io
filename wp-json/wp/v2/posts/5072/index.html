Part of her contribution we should be most grateful for is what she taught us about love.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>hooks is often and rightly lauded as a radical. One of her most radical and revolutionary positions was her view on the socially and politically transformative power of love. It\u2019s through love that we can begin to disconnect ourselves from materialism and systems of domination.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From romantic love to self-love, hooks was fearless and prolific in her advocacy for the concept. She saw what self-hatred and low self-esteem could do to people and, subsequently, whole movements; how through a lack of love fights against oppressive systems could end up feeding into and sustaining others; how when we fail to see the subjecthood of others we are liable to only be moved to action when our own self-interests are threatened.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/belhooksbase3b-1-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5091\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/belhooksbase3b-1-819x1024.jpg 819w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/belhooksbase3b-1-768x961.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/belhooksbase3b-1.jpg 901w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need what hooks called \u201ca love ethic\u201d, a shared commitment to the welfare of ourselves and others, to ground our struggles against structures of domination; \u201c&#8230; it is in choosing love, and beginning with love as the ethical foundation for politics, that we are best positioned to transform society in ways that enhance the collective good.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The definition of love hooks embraces sees love as \u201cthe will to extend one\u2019s self for the purpose of nurturing one\u2019s own or another\u2019s spiritual growth\u201d (M. Scott Peck). This, for hooks, got closer to the essence of love, and was a good place to start as a working universal definition upon which the foundations of our journeys to love could begin. To \u201cextend\u201d indicates action; understanding love as a verb was central to what hooks teaches us about loving.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"703\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/belhooksbase2-1024x703.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5076\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/belhooksbase2-1024x703.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/belhooksbase2-768x527.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/belhooksbase2-1536x1054.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/belhooksbase2-1320x906.jpg 1320w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/belhooksbase2.jpg 1728w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One needs to make a commitment to actively do the work on their inner self: reflecting on and honestly assessing one\u2019s internalised supremacist thinking, recognising and working through one\u2019s pain, learning to view oneself objectively and not through the gaze of materialism, classism or sexist ideals. We also make a commitment to the ones we choose to love.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it be the love we extend to ourselves, romantic partners, or our communities, \u201cto truly love we must learn to mix various ingredients &#8211; care, affection, recognition, respect, commitment, and trust, as well as honest and open communication.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"669\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/belhooksbase-1024x669.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5082\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/belhooksbase-1024x669.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/belhooksbase-768x502.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/belhooksbase-1536x1004.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/belhooksbase-2048x1338.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/belhooksbase-1320x863.jpg 1320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To love is to act counter to a culture that centres on individualism, materialism, and imperialism. It is to prioritise the authentic over the transactional, community over isolationism. \u201cThe moment we choose to love, we begin to move against domination, against oppression. The moment we choose to love we begin to move towards freedom, to act in ways that liberate ourselves and others. That action is the testimony of love as the practice of freedom.\u201d We should honour bell hooks by considering love thoughtfully and comprehensively in progressive discourse, recognising its spiritual as well as revolutionary value. And we should honour ourselves and our communities by choosing it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"footer\"> \nArticle written by Thuli Maseko, to keep up with her work follow her on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/thuliijane\" data-type=\"URL\">Instagram<\/a>.<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div id=spanwrap> While Bell Hooks has always been a giant in revolutionary thought, her recent <span id=span1> &#8230;<\/span><span id=span2> passing has heighted discussion of her work and the impact she has had <\/span><span id=span3> &#8230;<\/span><span id=span4> on individuals, movements, and progressive thinking.
