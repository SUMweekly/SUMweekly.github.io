Not a western pop but the Muslim equivalent of gospel music, she wanted me to go down that path but I was more into Rhianna\u2026.Shakira\u2026.this was at like six years-old. So yeah I\u2019d just watch them and be like that\u2019s what I wanted to do. I wanted to be on stage and sing and make people smile and jump around, the desire to be a singer came from when I was young.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I come from a family with very strong Muslim beliefs so they\u2019re not toooo keen on the route I\u2019m on, even when I\u2019m studying it. I used to study art at college and to them I needed to be someone else, \u2018You need to do Architecture at least? Be a lawyer, a pharmacist, a doctor?\u2019. They\u2019d always try and incorporate art into a more \u2018professional\u2019 setting\u2026 I guess they had higher standards. But they\u2019re letting me do my thing and I\u2019m enjoying it. When I was younger I\u2019d dream about it etcetera etcetera, and eventually that died out after I decided that it wasn\u2019t realistic enough.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Tuka-SUM-final-edits-1-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4323\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Tuka-SUM-final-edits-1-683x1024.jpg 683w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Tuka-SUM-final-edits-1-768x1152.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Tuka-SUM-final-edits-1.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019d watch these shows like X-Factor and I couldn\u2019t find anyone like me, anyone I could relate to, my second names Mohammed and I felt I could never be up there.

I guess I started relatively recently but I feel like it\u2019s always been part of me, in one shape or another, and now I\u2019ve reverted back to 6 year-old Tuka!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ep happened very organically, experimenting with different sounds and just getting comfortable together and finding our style. Eventually Ben started talking about releasing and we chose three songs that we the happiest with, the proudest of\u2026 three babies which got mixed and mastered! But we started thinking about it in 2019 and then obviously covid happened and all of a sudden the studio was closed, we couldn&#8217;t even finish the songs. Summer came around so we could get back in there and recorded Lost Sight.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>My friend Seb<strong> <\/strong>who spits came down and did a mad job! Literally in the first take did it perfectly 3 times to layer it and was done, bish bash bosh\u2026.but fate wasn\u2019t finished with us yet and a few days later <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/fuzzbrainmusic\/\">Fuzzbrain Studios<\/a><strong> <\/strong>burnt down! It was an amazing studio which Ben had built from the ground up with his dad, they\u2019d converted part of this warehouse into a fully functioning studio full of instruments and collections and tech which just disappeared.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>After the studio relocated to Ben\u2019s parent\u2019s house in Surrey we started to take trips down which was lovely, almost like a retreat.His parents were so accommodating, shouts out Bens Fam! So after a global pandemic, a few lockdowns and a fire we\u2019ve done it! I\u2019m proud of the whole gang and so grateful for everyone involved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m excited to start some new stuff, I want to explore a more middle-eastern sound and work with musicians from that region. In terms of performing I\u2019ve got a couple gigs coming up; Hoodstock on the 8th August, then obviously a session at your HQ !! Hoodstock is going to be great, a local festival full of good vibes. I think I wanna do as many gigs as I can, covids been a big obstacle be I\u2019m hopeful for the future\u2026 the best is yet to come.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"732\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/TUCAposterbg6-01-2-732x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4314\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/TUCAposterbg6-01-2-732x1024.jpg 732w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/TUCAposterbg6-01-2-768x1075.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/TUCAposterbg6-01-2-1097x1536.jpg 1097w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/TUCAposterbg6-01-2-1320x1847.jpg 1320w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/TUCAposterbg6-01-2.jpg 1464w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"footer\"> \nTuka will be performing an intimate live session at the new SUM HQ in Peckham, drop us a message for details and look out for the recording!
