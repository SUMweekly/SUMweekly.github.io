The large silver pot is turned upside down on the table and everyone gathers round eagerly waiting for the reveal. Will the shape of the rice hold together? What has the cook put inside this particular version? The pot is lifted and the beautiful dish is revealed. There are different variations of maqlouba, but to describe it simply, it is a dish of Palestinian origin (which is also found across the Levant) consisting of rice, vegetables, and often meat. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is arranged in layers and steamed to create a beautiful mould inside the pot. It is then flipped to serve, with the key ingredients cooked at the bottom to then appear at the top for the guests to marvel at. There are a few main variations of Maqlouba; chicken, lamb, fish and also vegetarian. The differences will appear with their own array of vegetables that pair well, as well as being dependent on its region. For instance, Maqlouba with fish is most commonly served in the south of Palestine due to the abundance of fish on the coast. This is similar to many regional dishes such as Jollof rice which will be prepared using different ingredients depending on the country you eat it in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the Maqlouba is flipped, we see the layers of its history, layers which have dated back to around the 12th Century. A popular story of its origin refers to the conquest of Jerusalem by Salaheddin Al Ayubbi. A very significant figure in the 12th Century, he was the founder of the Ayubbid empire, which at the height of its power ruled over large parts of the Levantine region. When he entered Jerusalem, he was greeted by the locals with the dish. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time it was referred to as \u2018bazenjaniyah\u2019, coming from the root word of \u2018Bazenjan\u2019 which means Aubergine in classical Arabic, a key ingredient in the dish. When Salaheddin saw the theatrical motion of the pot being flipped, he renamed the dish \u2018Maqlouba\u2019 which literally means inverted\/upside down. Naturally, this dish has grown to mean more than the ingredients it contains. People of all faiths who have descended from centuries of lineage in Jerusalem will view Maqlouba as a symbol of their right to the city.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the Maqlouba is flipped, it exudes an energy of defiance and symbolism which is unparalleled. During the Trump presidency, he recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a decision which was heavily contested in the region. Jerusalem is a heavily controlled region and so while physical protests would be strongly controlled, Maqlouba was used as a symbolic form of protest. Women sat outside of the walls of the Al-Aqsa mosque, flipping pots of maqlouba and serving it to the demonstrators. In any other circumstance this may be seen as a very common practice of support.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, knowing the history of this dish we can see that they were using Maqlouba as a metaphor, serving the dish as it was served to their historical leader Salaheddin. A subtle but powerful message that they will always hold the city to be theirs. Maqlouba isn\u2019t the only food which is used as a form of protest; watermelons have also been used in opposition to the IDF soldiers. Palestinians have previously walked the streets of Jerusalem with watermelons cut open. The vibrant reds, blacks and greens of the watermelon bearing the colours of the flag which is disallowed from being raised in certain areas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the issues between Palestine and Israel have remained a subject of the highest controversy in society&#8217;s discourse, it does not take away from the main messages raised in this piece. As I mentioned in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sumweekly.com\/fried-chicken\">\u2018The Fried Chicken Stereotype\u2019<\/a>, food holds the value it does because of our personal connection to it. Through the African Americans, fried chicken meant survival, and was one of the only forms of economic growth immediately after the emancipation. For the Palestinians, Maqlouba is a physical representation of their right to their home. The knowledge that a dish which you hold central to your identity, outlives modern conflicts by centuries is a tool more powerful than any signed law.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"ytoyo\" style=\"position:relative;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/1gjhocgQ5Wc\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Yusufs Maqlouba Recipe:<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"marginbottom\"><li>600 bone-in chicken pieces<\/li><li>2 Tbspn Salt<\/li><li>1 Tbspn Black Pepper<\/li><li>1 Tbspn Cumin<\/li><li>1 Tbspn Cardamom Powder<\/li><li>1 Tbspn Pimento Powder<\/li><li>1 Tbspn Cinnamon Powder<\/li><li>1 Tbspn Coriander Powder<\/li><li>1 Head of Cauliflower<\/li><li>500g Potatoes<\/li><li>3 Medium Carrots<\/li><li>300g Basmati Sella Rice<\/li><li>2 tbsp toasted pine nuts<\/li><\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>1.

Cover with a small amount of stock so the bottom doesn\u2019t stick and simmer for 20 minutes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6.
