I\u2019ve been in the music industry for a little bit, I wanted to use whatever links I had to push Lakuna.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We got in the studio but then obviously Covid hit, it was a bit of a weird one, it was a long time of writing and some of the early tunes ended up getting cut. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily a bad thing tho, it\u2019s good to experiment.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large collapseaboveright\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/lakunasum3-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4433\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/lakunasum3-683x1024.jpg 683w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/lakunasum3-768x1152.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/lakunasum3-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/lakunasum3-1320x1980.jpg 1320w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/lakunasum3.jpg 1366w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>And what\u2019s the process, how do your songs get written?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Esme:<\/span> &nbsp;It changes from tune to tune, but I\u2019d say usually Ben comes up with some chords, I\u2019ll send over some vocals and then we\u2019ll get into the studio for Stan to do his thangggg.&nbsp; Sometimes it comes from a Jam or a beat, something a bit more organic. But during lockdown times it was a bit harder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Stan:<\/span> Yeah it was great when we could get back to doing things in person. You can still get stuff done remotely but it\u2019s&nbsp; a LOT slower and feels way less natural.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/lakunasum2-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4424\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/lakunasum2-1024x683.png 1024w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/lakunasum2-768x512.png 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/lakunasum2-1536x1025.png 1536w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/lakunasum2-1320x881.png 1320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Did you find any positives out of Lockdown? Obviously you\u2019re locked-in for days on end with nothing else to do but make tunes<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ben:<\/span> Obviously to be deprived of actual connection, seeing your friends, it can take it\u2019s toll on how you\u2019re feeling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Esme:<\/span><strong> <\/strong>I definitely think some of my lyrics are lockdown-inspired, channelling those feelings into the music.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When I listen to the EP I wouldn\u2019t say it was exactly a happy, good-vibes record. It seems more dark, atmospheric, do you think that reflected the mood you were in at the time?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Stan:<\/span> I think it\u2019s also about escapism, a lot of the tunes are quite dreamy. It might not be necessarily a positive tune but it&#8217;s trying to help you escape reality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Esme:<\/span> It\u2019s been a year and a half since the we started making it, so I think it encapsulates quite a rollercoaster of emotions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"inlinevideo\" class=\"wp-block-video marginbottom\"><video controls src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/lakunasumhq.mp4\"><\/video><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What\u2019s your favorite track from the EP ? Is it something you can all agree on?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Esme:<\/span> For me it\u2019s probably first in line, although Golden Intentions is like our baby, it\u2019s come so far. We started working on it between lockdowns, but before the bleak winter one when shit got dark. We decided to make a video because its just vibes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Stan:<\/span> It was one of the early tracks on the EP, and getting Poppy Daniels to come and do her thing on that track. She\u2019s super busy so it was great to have her.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So how was making the video for it ?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Esme:<\/span> It was amazing, we had Eleanor Graham as our Creative Director, she\u2019s got a very clear vision and was so easy to work with, so it all went very smoothly. One of my Uni mates came and danced for us. It was very hit-and-miss with the weather, but luckily Eleanor manifested us some sunshine!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>And now the EP and video are out, what\u2019s next for Lakuna?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ben:<\/span> I\u2019m just in the mindset where I want to make more music. I think I\u2019ve felt the least inhibited in the last year to make music and release it, so I just want to make more of that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Esme:<\/span> I think we want to try experiment more, try different vibes and sounds\u2026 switch things up. We\u2019ve got a sound which has evolved from the last EP, but there\u2019s always room to grow and develop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns collapse-above-right\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p><strong>Is there anyone you would love to collaborate with?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ben:<\/span> I\u2019d love to start working with different artists and producers, try to reach out to people outside of our genre<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Stan:<\/span> There\u2019s a Dub producer Scientist who\u2019d id love to work with, maybe remix one of our tunes, but who knows.. I think as we progress cool collars will just naturally come out of the wood work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ben:<\/span> Definitely, we\u2019ve already worked with so many amazing artists. Theres been the king-of-sax Solaariss, Louis Keating who played some amazing keys on a couple of our tunes, Max Fraser who\u2019s featured on two of the tunes and will be back working with us soon and then obviously the amazing Poppy Daniels.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"732\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/lakuna-02-732x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4468\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/lakuna-02-732x1024.png 732w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/lakuna-02-768x1074.png 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/lakuna-02-1098x1536.png 1098w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns noborderbottom\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"700\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/a1021047986_16.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4474\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/a1021047986_16.jpg 700w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/a1021047986_16-200x200.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<div id=\"artistlinkwrap\" class=\"noborderbottom\">\n<div id=\"artistlink\">\n  <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/album\/4Q2wD6Enpc8MI5omoGdDit\" data-type=\"URL\" class=\"muslink spotify\"><div id=\"muslinktext\">Spotify<\/div><\/a>\n  <a href=\"https:\/\/music.apple.com\/us\/album\/where-we-go-ep\/1576668619\" data-type=\"URL\" class=\"muslink apple\"><div id=\"muslinktext\">Apple Music<\/div><\/a>\n  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.deezer.com\/en\/album\/244619202\" data-type=\"URL\" class=\"muslink deezer\"><div id=\"muslinktext\">Deezer<\/div><\/a>\n  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/gp\/product\/B099KHJKFS\/ref=dm_ws_sp_ps_dp\" data-type=\"URL\" class=\"muslink amazon\"><div id=\"muslinktext\">Amazon<\/div><\/a>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"footer\"> \nCheck out the full EP \u2018Where We Go\u2019.
