As he began to find his own way in music he fell in love with artists such as Stevie Wonder, Bill Withers, Earth Wind &amp; Fire and Aretha Franklin, and cites them as great inspiration. Maxi spent a large part of his childhood with his family in America, experiencing a rich culture of music in cities like New York, Baltimore (as well as London), a perfect reference point for the unique sound he has established.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maxi Millz releases his highly anticipated debut EP \u2018Captions\u2019 alongside visuals for \u2018Screen Time\u2019. Following both \u2018Danny Ocean\u2019 and \u2018MDNA\u2019 which dropped recently, Maxi has generated an undeniable buzz and set the tone for what\u2019s to follow. The 8-track project showcases Maxi\u2019s falsetto and highly developed sound which is a fusion of R&amp;B, Hip-Hop and Funk.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"686\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/maxi1-686x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2947\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/maxi1-686x1024.jpg 686w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/maxi1-768x1146.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/maxi1-1029x1536.jpg 1029w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/maxi1-1320x1970.jpg 1320w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/maxi1.jpg 1373w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The project is about relationships, the highs and lows, the different stages&#8230; from the Infatuation filled honeymoon stage to the boring routine that a lot of relationships fall into, I tried to condense all the emotions I have felt in relationships, small and big, into a small project, Captions. \u2018Screen Time\u2019 is a simplelight hearted, quarantine relatable video for a song that I think a people will understand.
