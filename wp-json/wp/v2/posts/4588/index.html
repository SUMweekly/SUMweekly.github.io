From dreaming of Beyonce to single handedly running the tech at the recent Bottle Factory event, Grace is force of nature who lights up whatever room she\u2019s in. We sat down with her for a coffee to decompress after a hectic month, and find out how she became one of South-London&#8217;s most talented exports.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns collapse-above-right\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p><strong>So what brought you to London?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spent the first 15 years of my life in Italy. I moved to London around 8 years ago and have been here ever since. It was my parents decision really, there wasn\u2019t a discussion it was \u201cYour coming\u201d. Essentially the economy was in a bad way in Italy, lack of Jobs and bad business\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I\u2019ve been to Italy a few times and obviously you hear stories..how was it growing up as a person of colour there?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like I grew up quite naively, my main concern back then was to be the popular girl that everybody liked, I didn\u2019t see those nuances of me being a black person. I just had the regular issues that any other 12-year-old girl would have at that time, I didn\u2019t&nbsp; really have a first hand experience of racism.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming to London was a big shock. I grew up being one of the only black people in my class and even the entire school, to being just anybody in&nbsp; South-East, one of many!<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/sum2-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4596\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/sum2-683x1024.jpg 683w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/sum2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/sum2-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/sum2-1320x1980.jpg 1320w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/sum2.jpg 1366w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>And did that feel good?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ummm no.. I didn\u2019t have many black friends in Italy and didn\u2019t get to really experience the culture. Fast-forward to Catford, people weren\u2019t that welcoming. In secondary school people would make fun of my accent, it was hard at first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I guess it can be hard to fit into the culture, even when you look like you should belong<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exactly, I didn\u2019t have a solid group of black friends till University.

Studying music in Italy is quite different compared to London, the education system is completely different. For me to pursue a music career and study I would of had to go to a conservatoire, and I wasn\u2019t about to do that\u2026. I took that little dream and put it in a box for a while.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I moved to London I realised how easier and less stressful it was to have music classes etcetera, so I opened up that box! So I studied Music Performance in college and then switched to production in Uni.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What caused that switch to production?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I definitely still consider myself an artist and do want to release music, but I had a sound engineering module in college and absolutely loved it. <\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Being in the studio\u2026Mic\u2019ing up, it was so much fun. When I was looking into it I found out about Rick Rubin (Def Jam founder and influential producer), the point is he doesn\u2019t really do much on the console, he\u2019s more of an idea\u2019s guy who helps shape the music.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I decided to switch to production, studying performance didn\u2019t really make sense to me and I didn\u2019t feel like I needed a piece of paper which said OK I can sing songs. I wanted to get the technical stuff down. I then moved onto live sound engineering which I love, I guess its kind-of a back-up plan but I can see myself doing shows, festivals, travelling around. My plan is that I\u2019ll be an Audio Engineer and if I then blow up and become the next Beyonce, So be it !!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/sum1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4610\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/sum1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/sum1-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/sum1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/sum1-1320x880.jpg 1320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I feel like there\u2019s a stereotype of \u2018The Sound Guy\u2019, is this something you\u2019ve had to deal with in the past?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s the thing, when it comes to anything technical, there is not much female representation, let alone black female representation. Everyone does assume that the person doing the sound is a guy\u2026 but it doesn\u2019t bother me too much, be the change you want to see right? I don\u2019t want it to affect me and think \u2018Oh my god why do they think I\u2019m going to be a man\u2019, instead I\u2019ll just show up, do my job and show them that I know what I\u2019m doing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do wonder why it\u2019s the case, why must any technical, science-related job be only for men to pursue? I\u2019m hoping that with time passing it will change, and I guess my presence will help that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/sum7-1-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4612\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/sum7-1-683x1024.jpg 683w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/sum7-1-768x1152.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/sum7-1-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/sum7-1-1320x1980.jpg 1320w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/sum7-1.jpg 1366w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p><strong>Are there opportunities and programs to help people like you in the music industry?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mmmmmmmm (<em>big pause)\u2026.<\/em>No. When you ask me that question I\u2019m thinking of organisations or projects and I can\u2019t see them. It\u2019s different for an artist to find opportunities and schemes compared to a lawyer, there\u2019s less of an establishment. And it\u2019s the same with being a black tech, there\u2019s not an establishment I can go to and say \u201cI\u2019m a black female tech, help me out!!!\u201d. You have to scavenge and research.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although I did get lucky, during the black lives matter protests the musicians <em>Nao <\/em>and <em>Mura Masa <\/em>created a ten-week course for black women in music tech (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nativemgmt.co.uk\/3t\">3T<\/a>). Which is something that was unheard of. I was super lucky to be a part of that.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It\u2019s mad that the murder of a black man halfway across the world had to be the catalyst for projects like that.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know what I mean??? But I\u2019m very grateful for what that project gave me, it activated a domino effect which led me to getting a job as an engineer. But at the same time, it shouldn\u2019t have to be like that. I wish it was normalised, I am an actual unicorn! Don\u2019t get me wrong, it feels great and I love the attention, but why? Comments like \u201coh wow you\u2019re actually really good at your job\u201d. Okay I get it I\u2019m smart, beautiful, crazy and sexy but it shouldn\u2019t be so special for me to be a tech!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/sumgrace-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4616\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/sumgrace-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/sumgrace-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/sumgrace-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/sumgrace-1320x990.jpg 1320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like I\u2019m more of an ideas person, I love singing and free-flowing thoughts.
