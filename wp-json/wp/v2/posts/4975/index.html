There are things the legal system afforded Kyle that it would rarely extend to others. The response from police and a justice system that not only punishes POC perpetrators more harshly but goes so far as to actively vilify these groups, even targeting the innocent, of letting off a man (with sympathy) after he killed two people is probably the starkest display of white privilege I\u2019ve seen in a while.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of us were likely in that familiar mindset of being wholly unsurprised yet still feeling a painful sense of injustice. The verdict isn\u2019t the (only) thing that triggers such feelings. It\u2019s the entire system that enabled not only a not guilty verdict to be reached, but that also enabled Kyle to leave Kenosha alive after entering with a semi-automatic weapon and shooting three people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"847\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/rittenhouse2-1024x847.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4988\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/rittenhouse2-1024x847.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/rittenhouse2-768x635.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/rittenhouse2-1536x1271.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/rittenhouse2-1320x1092.jpg 1320w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/rittenhouse2.jpg 1610w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption><em>Kyle Rittenhouse alongside another armed &#8220;Property Defender&#8221;  [Adam Rogan via AP]<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably the most obvious place to start in differentiating how law enforcement treats Black bodies and white bodies is Kyle Rittenhouse walking up to police with a rifle. It\u2019s almost inconceivable that a Black person would make it past police officers carrying a gun, especially when Black people, younger and smaller than Kyle, have been killed by police who even just suspected they were armed. And when Black people are legally armed, their Second Amendment right is very rarely respected or defended with the same gusto (recall Philando Castile).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<p>Kyle\u2019s not subject to profiling in the same way POC groups are, he\u2019s therefore more humanised, more individualised, and thus, more sympathetic. That\u2019s what allowed the defense to put him on the stand with confidence, what allowed him to be seen as a young man with a future etc etc\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>why people will see him as someone who wanted to serve his community and not a violent, pesky instigator. Conservatism and white supremacy also play a role here, as the victims were white but not an \u201cacceptable\u201d whiteness by the conscious or unconscious standards of these groups.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/rittenhouse1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4985\" width=\"396\" height=\"461\"\/><figcaption><em>Rittenhouse&#8217;s Mugshot [Antioch Police Department via AP]<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>These were white people who had aligned themselves with Black Lives Matter and were threats to what white supremacy and the American system wants to uphold. Their rejection despite being white illustrates the institutional conservatism that permeates these systems along with the institutional racism. We saw this to the extent that Judge Bruce Schroeder didn\u2019t allow those killed to be referred to as victims, because the term was considered too \u201cloaded,\u201d but said that they could be called \u201clooters,\u201d \u201crioters\u201d and \u201carsonists\u201d, as if these weren\u2019t loaded terms that would influence a jury in any way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The victims of the shootings are not offered the same grace as having acted in self-defence, either. After seeing someone kill a man, they pursued&nbsp; him, fired warning shots and attempted to disarm him, yet Kyle was seen as the party in danger. Compared to the actions of the protestors it\u2019s Kyle\u2019s that stand out as more unreasonable, violent and aggressive, but he has the armour of white boyhood and the status quo, so this was never going to be part of the narrative.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/https___cdn.cnn_.com_cnnnext_dam_assets_211123000103-01-tucker-carlson-kyle-rittenhouse-interview-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4992\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/https___cdn.cnn_.com_cnnnext_dam_assets_211123000103-01-tucker-carlson-kyle-rittenhouse-interview-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/https___cdn.cnn_.com_cnnnext_dam_assets_211123000103-01-tucker-carlson-kyle-rittenhouse-interview-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/https___cdn.cnn_.com_cnnnext_dam_assets_211123000103-01-tucker-carlson-kyle-rittenhouse-interview-1056x594.jpg 1056w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/https___cdn.cnn_.com_cnnnext_dam_assets_211123000103-01-tucker-carlson-kyle-rittenhouse-interview.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption><em>Whitewashing on Fox News<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The acceptance of Kyle in both mainstream and conservative circles also highlights the conservative context in which the killings and trial took place and how these add to Kyle\u2019s privilege index. Republican senators are offering him jobs, Tucker Carlson did an interview, and far right groups are citing the case as setting a precedent for vigilante action. His attaining martyrdom status among Republican, mainstream and far right extremist groups, and that going largely unquestioned, is an important backdrop to Kyle&#8217;s acquittal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine if an official came out hailing the Nation of Islam or the Black Panthers as heroes\u2026 Attitudes towards non-white groups, extremist or otherwise, have historically been a lot more damning form law enforcement, government and society. Despite white supremacy and white supremacist groups being acknowldedged by the FBI as possibly the most dangerous domestic threat to the United States, a disproportionate amount of time and resources continue to be spent on the comparative over-policing and over-surveillance of non-white groups and individuals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"695\" src=\"http:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Screenshot-2021-12-07-at-23.13.23-copy-1024x695.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4994\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Screenshot-2021-12-07-at-23.13.23-copy-1024x695.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Screenshot-2021-12-07-at-23.13.23-copy-768x521.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Screenshot-2021-12-07-at-23.13.23-copy-1536x1043.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Screenshot-2021-12-07-at-23.13.23-copy-1320x896.jpg 1320w, https:\/\/sumweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Screenshot-2021-12-07-at-23.13.23-copy.jpg 1950w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><em>Judge Bruce Schroeder during the case [Pool via Getty Images]<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Kyle is given the benefit of the doubt. Instead of being considered a chaos tourist, right-wing counter protestor looking for trouble or even just someone who\u2019s not where he was supposed to be, he\u2019s seen as the victim who had to defend himself against looting aggressors. Black folk have been treated more suspiciously for being in their own neighbourhoods and colleges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s that same benefit of the doubt that lets a mass shooter be bought Burger King or a rapist have their swim times published, because somewhere inside them people see a good young man with a future, a future white observers are invested in for one reason or another. The point is it\u2019s their shared whiteness that forms the root of this investment, which factors into why we see disproportionate outcomes in the justice system, why Black men receive sentences up to 20 percent longer than whites for the same crimes, why Chrystul Kizer is still awaiting trial and facing life in prison.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are things Kyle gets because he\u2019s white that other groups don\u2019t, things that oftentimes the system is designed for POC not to get. Kyle can claim all he wants that this all has \u201cnothing to do with race,\u201d but that\u2019s an ignorant position that itself comes from a place of privilege. He had told interviewers \u201cpart of my job is to protect people.

They were looters, rioters and arsonists. Kyle was doing his duty, protecting private property (another ideal that\u2019s politically, economically and racially loaded).
