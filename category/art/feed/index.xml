<p><strong>From what started off as a twist on a monotonous school project, Mitchell Bradshaw Design has grown into a one man home production, all the while staying true to his roots in SE London.⁠ For his earliest project Mitchell came out with a collection of re-designed long rizlas, before dropping the ‘Never Pay’ project, which generated a lot of attention toward the artist and built his reputation for savvy, tongue-in-cheek design.⁠</strong></p>



<p>MBD is not really a Brand, I would just say I&#8217;m an artist or designer..and that just happens to be the name of the account..</p>



<p>I try to do things I&#8217;m interested in, and it just so happens that a lot of other people are interested too. Rather than thinking, what do teenagers wanna read about? I just think, I’m a teenager, what do I wanna read about?</p>



<p><strong><em>Tell me about the ‘Never Pay’ Project?&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>I asked everyone to give the stations with no barriers, like a community study, together we can figure this out’ ‘&#8230;and I believe in it, I think travel should be free, I think it&#8217;s a really limiting factor and it should be paid for by the government, but they&#8217;re never gonna do that so you gotta figure out how to do it yourself..</p>



<p><strong><em>Do you have a strict creative process?</em></strong></p>



<p>I’m bare lazy most of the time..But you can&#8217;t really rush having an idea, the best part of the process <em>is</em> getting an idea and thinking I know what I want this to look like, and then just working on it for hours. Sometimes I stress myself out way too much about it, it happen when it happens</p>



<p>I remember in school we did a lesson on photoshop and I just got into it. I feel like when you&#8217;re a kid, you have this mad energy, and you&#8217;re bored and you don&#8217;t really know what to do, but i was luckily into it, so got to spend hours fuckin around and slowly learning it. I also liked the safety of it, but since last summer I got back into drawing</p>



<p><strong><em>Anyone you&#8217;re interested in collaborating with?</em></strong></p>



<p>I&#8217;m not a very good collaborator, but with something like a magazine, while I make it for me as the target audience, the audience is actually bare different man, girls and different races, you know &#8211; I am just a white boy making it for a white boy.. So I wanna branch out</p>



<p>I find commission work quite stressful, everyone wants mad deals and stuff. It&#8217;s like making a piece of work, and every five minutes having to get an opinion from them, it&#8217;s just not really the way I like to work. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m not a very collaborative worker, and also why I want to make a separate magazine with a bunch of different editors on it, but also keep my magazine, cos it interests me.</p>



<p><strong><em>What do you want to do as MBD grows bigger, assuming you don&#8217;t want to stop?</em></strong></p>



<p>I&#8217;m gonna launch a publishing company or something where I can help publish people&#8217;s books or help design them. And when I launch I&#8217;m gonna bring back some of the old things; the longs, the posters. It&#8217;s gonna be called <strong><em>Never Pay Press</em></strong><em>…</em></p>

<p><strong>Coming from Austria via Belgium, Fiona is a mixed-heritage artist who confronts issues of race, belonging and identity in her work. She spoke to SUM about her experiences in the commercial design industry and how she uses her art to understand and reflect the many cultures she has experienced in her path as an artist.</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>Fiona:&nbsp;I’d call myself a multimedia artist…which is kind of a basic explanation, but maybe with a focus on design? My work revolves around belonging, heritage and race. I’m trying to underline the marginalised voices of people who don’t have enough say in our society.</p>



<p>I grew up in Brussels, my mums Austrian and my Dads Nigerian and I was raised the “Austrian Way”. I was never perceived as a Belgian, nor as an Austrian or Nigerian person. I always wanted to study philosophy, but I liked the artists approach to viewing the world and enjoyed experimenting with colour etc… so I thought “fuck it” let’s be an artist. I’m now doing a course on advertising and brand design; I get to explore quite a wide range of different mediums, but the focus is very commercially driven and whitewashed. The way the course educates us to fit into the white industry isn’t enjoyable, but at the same time, it’s helped me think critically and given me a wider experience.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="683" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fihs2-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4155" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fihs2-683x1024.jpg 683w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fihs2-768x1152.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fihs2-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fihs2-1320x1980.jpg 1320w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fihs2.jpg 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></figure>
</div>
</div>



<p><strong>I guess with advertising the primary objective is to sell stuff right?</strong></p>



<p>Right, and I guess I could have figured that out from the title of the course, but it was sold to me as a very creative multicultural course, however, we only focus on briefs from big white led cooperation. It feels really numbing to my creative practice.</p>



<p><strong>So kind-of Eurocentric, finance-facing work?</strong></p>



<p>Exactly, we did a brief with Barclays, Giff-Gaff and so on. Very commercial and simplistic designs, every time I try to add a bit of colour I get in trouble! It’s all rooted in cultural capital, and I think the way design is perceived needs to be changed, in order to give a voice to non-swiss design.&nbsp; So, I’m in my last year now and am mainly focused on finishing my dissertation and my self-directed projects which I find interesting.</p>



<p>I always wanted to explore the identity and feeling of belonging of mixed-race people, as this is a demographic I can relate to. I know it’s very delicate as we are holding the most privileges when compared to the rest of the Black community and of course, colourism is a huge problem. I want to make a safe space where we can explore our issues but also explore our privileges and see how we can elevate the black community rather than indulge in the mixed-race proximity to whiteness.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fihs1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4160" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fihs1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fihs1-768x512.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fihs1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fihs1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fihs1-1320x880.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Can you elaborate?</strong></p>



<p>At first, I wanted to address every mixed-race person, but the first problem I faced is: who identifies as mixed-race? I decided to focus on the biggest mixed-race group in the UK which is Black African and White and Black West Indies and White people.&nbsp; This demographic is the one I can identify the most with. Furthermore, I realised it was a class and gender conversation, as well as where you were born and raised. Everyone has a different experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My focus became mixed-race femme-identifying individuals. I started organising photoshoots that are accompanied by individual interview sessions or focus groups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After collecting the images and interviews I’m then planning on putting together a zine which I will hopefully launch the next year 2022. I want this to be a safe space open for people to learn and explore, learn about each other’s experiences, and find peace with one’s identity living in split worlds.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>As a mix-race person, do you wish that you had a greater feeling of belonging? Or are you quite content with you dual-heritage and the fact that you have been able to experience so many different cultures and nationalities?</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fi13-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4137" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fi13-768x1024.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fi13-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fi13-1320x1760.jpg 1320w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fi13.jpg 1537w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>I think there are two sides to it, and I have experienced both sides. We hold a lot of power as mixed-race individuals due to our proximity to whiteness &#8211; I think we need to be very aware of that. Our mixed skin tone helps us connect to different demographics and cultures easier. I feel like mixed-race individuals navigate the world by adapting as they will never be surrounded by the same group except for their siblings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, there is also a feeling of isolation I have experienced. As an example: When I was younger, I always felt Austrian having been raised by my Austrian single mom. Nevertheless, when experiencing racist abuse both from family members and the wider public I felt very rejected realising I will never be perceived as fully Austrian. The feeling of wanting to belong emerged and grew in me. The first time I perfectly blended in was in Morocco. A place I have no connection within terms of heritage, however a place I felt so accepted in. Nobody questioned my heritage and background, nobody asked me where I was from.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p><strong>Considering your art, are you always trying to consider these issues of race and heritage in your work? Do you ever make a piece without trying to incorporate a social commentary?</strong></p>



<p>I think as much as I try not to be influenced by my surroundings, I am drawn to the experience of Jean Dubuffet (A post-war artist, famed for founding the “Art Brut” movement).  He attempted to make art that was completely separated from the context of society, but then realised it was impossible, there will always be influences in society that affect how you create a piece of art. Because I think about identity and race so much, it’s impossible to stop them from influencing my work. It might be a phase, my work used to be a lot about capitalism and our superficial society, so who knows what’s next. Whatever needs focus.</p>



<p><strong>I know you call yourself a multimedia artist, which seems to be a very common thing these days, but what’s your preferred medium?</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>I love oil pastels, fine liners, and pencils. After I create a piece, I usually photograph the piece and then use things like photoshop to change the piece into something else, so the finished product is usually a print. I do have original works, but I feel like the power of erasing, merging, cutting out and copying does help on a digital device.</p>



<p><strong>How do you marry your interests in industry and design with your work as an artist? Is the end goal to be an entirely self-sufficient artist without needing to do any commercial work?</strong></p>



<p>I think I’m, still learning, building, and figuring out what I want to do. It would be ideal to have my art and my style as an artist serve as the main source of income. By receiving commissions who ask for my art style, my hope grows that I could become a successful artist. Ideally, I’d like to scrap all the commercial work as it just fulfils the need for money. My main goal is to collaborate with people that share similar values to mine.  </p>

<p><strong>What kind of projects do you have coming up?</strong></p>



<p>I am a volunteer for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yeoja_mag/">Yeoja Magazine</a>, which is an intersectional Berlin-based feminist magazine. We interview different artists, and I would like to start writing more articles about the Queer Black community. Furthermore, I am working on small commissions and am hopeful I can expand my print business and expand that further. </p>

<p>Founded by Nigerian-American designer Niyi Okuboyejo, Post-Imperial is a fusion of bright modernity and traditional techniques. “The Post-Imperial aesthetic is a colorful and vibrant ode to new forms of fashion. It carries a strong sense of optimism for the future,” combining traditional African artisanship with contemporary diasporic existence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their latest collection, <a href="https://post-imperial.com/blogs/mythology-new/that-time-i-wanted-to-be-seen">That Time I Wanted to be Seen</a>, is inspired by the shared internal desire to be seen in one way or another at some point in our lives. It takes inspiration from a variety of African cultures and traditions, from West-African percussion instruments to traditional Massai jewelry, as well as aspects of American identity, like the Greater Refuge Temple, “which stands as a religious pillar in the Harlem community.” </p>



<p>Okuboyejo draws greatly on his Nigerian roots. Using traditional African techniques and textiles, the clothes are crafted by African artisans and many fabrics are dyed using Adire, a traditional Yoruba resist dye technique developed in south-western Nigeria. Central to the label, also, is the tradition of mythology, collective stories that are shared among and contributed to by our community. </p>



<p>Through putting community and collective storytelling at the center of the brand, Post-Imperial moves beyond having a single narrative at the center of creation, instead embodying mythology. “[Narrative] is ego-centric. It’s you wanting to grab some sort of power, you wanting to tell the story. [Mythology] is more of a community… Everyone has participated in this story, so it becomes a story that is embodied in them.” Post-Imperial’s approach represents a decentering of the individual in a traditionally individualistic artform. </p>



<p>The label is unlike others in the mainstream with its unique and humanising approach to design. It puts collaboration at the forefront of the creative process, and in so doing, works the complexities and nuances of dismantling power structures into Post-Imperial creations. There’s also an optimistic, future-facing ethos that features in much of African and diasporic creation.</p>



<p>“Post-Imperial is the embodiment of collaborative storytelling. We are all mythmakers. Let’s make myths together.”</p>

<p><strong><em>Nessie Appleton-Smith is a South London based creative who focuses on all things visual. After spending the last few years at university focusing on her videography, Nessie recently took a series of intimate portraits of the Okoli family….</em></strong></p>



<p>I love personal portraits, up close, really detailed. I’m trying to capture a sense of the person, who they are, what they like, that sort of thing. The best is when the subject is talking about something they’re passionate about, the feeling of excitement and passion can translate well to an image.</p>



<p>I’ve known the<strong> </strong>Okoli’s<strong> </strong>for a long time, Annabel and I<strong> </strong>went to school together. Her family is so cool, they all dress so well and are beautiful people. I wanted to take images that captured the way I see them so they dressed themselves and we did the shoot in their home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The shoot on the day was lovely, we spent so much time just catching up, we haven’t seen each other in a while especially during covid. They’re all in such different stages of life.. graduations, secondary school, it was great to have individual talks to see where they’re at.</p>



<p>I’ve started shooting a new semi-autobiographical series called <strong><em>Schools Out</em></strong>. The idea is to take photographs of young queer kids who are still in school. I started a LGBTQ+ society in my old school which is still going on, it had such a great impact on my experience of growing up as a queer kid. I</p>



<p>I got in contact with some kids who are still a part of the society and took some photos outside of the school, places where I used to hang out a lot. Over the next couple of years I want to capture groups of queer kids and their friends so I can show how important it is to have a sense of that community at a young age, I was really fortunate to have that when I was younger. It’s kind of like a love letter to my queer friends growing up, and to anyone else who’s experiencing something similar.</p>

<p>Azuma Makoto&#8217;s botanical sculptures have gained worldwide fame for their attention-grabbing arrangements and extreme locations.</p>



<p>His latest work was the re-imaginging of a 19th century paludarium, used to create a ecosystem to preserve botanical life. Full of technological overkill, Makoto&#8217;s paludarium gives us an idea of how life may need to be preserved after the destruction of the natural world…</p>

<p>Nachael Catnott is a Black British-Caribbean Artist and Experimental Filmmaker living in South London. Nachael focuses on documenting historic and modern relationships between people and places, whilst conceptually evaluating the current and evolving social-political landscape.</p>



<p>“I have a passion for producing dynamic and thought-provoking content that engages with diverse audiences. My practice is intent on addressing issues such as race, class, heritage and gender through a multitude of mediums namely, film, photography, performance and sculpture.”</p>



<p>We sat down with Nachael for an extended interview, exploring her work, accessibility and how a yam became a re-ocurring symbol in her work…</p>



<p><strong>Talk to me a bit about South London and your work</strong></p>



<p>I think in general a lot of my work is interested in giving a voice to underrepresented people and trying to find out stories or histories or identities that people might not have that much information about. That started during my BA where I started to look more into my own personal identity. I started using yam as a reference and a symbol of the black experience and the presence of multiculturalism in Britain.</p>



<p>Ultimately for me, coming from South London, that’s kind of my foundation; that’s where I had the experience of growing up with so many different people from different walks of life&#8230; predominantly in an area like Lewisham, you do have such a class spectrum as well and just so many different nationalities; I think that’s why it’s at the heart of a lot of what I do.</p>



<p>And I think it’s just a case of being from a place like south London, I feel like for me I’ve always been trying to sort of show what we can do.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="573" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Few-Stains-of-Colour-1-2-1024x573.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4963" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Few-Stains-of-Colour-1-2-1024x573.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Few-Stains-of-Colour-1-2-768x430.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Few-Stains-of-Colour-1-2-1536x860.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Few-Stains-of-Colour-1-2-1320x739.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>How do you decide what goes into a piece?</strong></p>



<p>I guess it’s a feeling. The red puffer jacket series came about through my interest in fashion and the adaptation and appropriation of fashion items. Fast fashion especially has taken a lot from streetwear and what used to be associated with working class people. I just think it’s interesting with the flow of society how a lot of these references are now kind of everyday things. And you’re seeing references to different cultures in high fashion with what I feel like is not the right reference, which is where we lead into the exploitation and the appropriation side of things.</p>



<p>With Daughters of Hannah there’s references to my recent journey into spirituality. We went to that same church school &#8211; everyone thinks it’s really random but that was a journey going there! So there’s a lot of reference there to my personal journey with spirituality, also making references to different religions and how they combine, and using the yam as kind of this anchor.</p>



<p>I’m just interested in a lot of the conversations that I have and I think in the last year I’ve been more interested in trying to create a more positivity led black experience. Naturally lots of the documentaries I’ve worked on tend to have some references to the struggle because I think that’s kind of the start of a lot of people’s stories, especially people of colour, so I wanted to create a more positive outlook on blackness.</p>



<p>A big reference for me is, because I’ve lived and grown up here, being a third generation of migrants. A lot of my references can only come though second hand information, whether it’s those conversations I’m having with my granddad or when I go and visit the Caribbean when get to do so.</p>



<p>Also the internet or books, secondary sources really, so I guess I’m also interested in looking at those connections, whether it’s beach landscapes that I have access to in the UK versus, I guess, the Homeland. There’s a lot of trying to find those pockets of spaces in Britain.</p>



<p><strong>Do you find not having access to those ancestral spaces as a member of the diaspora something limiting or empowering in your work?</strong></p>



<p>I feel like there’s been this shift, especially with the rise in politics around BLM. I think there’s been this embracing, especially within the Caribbean community, of what is the wider diaspora and with African heritage. It feels like there’s more of a community coming together.</p>



<p>No one questions when I make reference to Africa in my work because I’ve always had the knowledge, whether that’s through my parents talking about the struggle, whether it’s slavery, whether it’s ancestry… I’ve always been very interested in my wider ancestry and heritages.</p>



<p>I definitely feel like since using predominantly yam as a medium I’ve been able to lean more into the diaspora and have my work feel like it has a presence within that community if you know what I mean.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Recollection2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4944" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Recollection2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Recollection2-768x432.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Recollection2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Recollection2-1056x594.jpg 1056w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Recollection2-1320x743.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Do you ever feel that the discrimination that comes with being Black can hinder how freely you can express yourself in your work?</strong></p>



<p>That’s interesting because I had an ‘in conversation’ session with an artist called Janette Parris &#8211; she’s a Goldmiths alumni and a renowned artist, and she now lives and practices in the South London area &#8211; and she was speaking about how it’s almost like as soon as you’re a black artist, suddenly your work has to be hyper-political. Like you can’t just paint flowers, it suddenly becomes ‘black artist paints flowers’, and you become this political symbol, your art becomes this political symbol, just because you’re black.</p>



<p>Daniel Kaluuya said the same thing about just wanting to be an actor and I think he got dragged for that because people were like “oh you’re supposed to be this champion, you’re meant to stand for the black kings” and he wasn’t saying he’s not happy to do that…</p>



<p>When you look at so many shows I used to watch when I was younger in the black section of Netflix, and back in the day it would just be a rom-com but now it’s a ‘black’ love story. That’s what’s really interesting: it becomes quite hard to categorise, because obviously in one breath we’re advocating for more inclusivity and black stories but we don’t want to, within that, be marginalised and turned into this one trick pony.</p>



<p>And I think at the moment a lot of my work naturally has reference to race because at the moment I’ve used, or it’s been easier to use, my own identity to investigate what’s going on in the political climate. It just so happens that we’re going through another epidemic or continued epidemic when it comes to racism, so then the work becomes more poignant and it feels more political than it actually probably is. Whereas a lot of the work, especially for me recently, is becoming more like self-discovery.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="577" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Recollection1-1024x577.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4943" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Recollection1-1024x577.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Recollection1-768x433.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Recollection1-1536x865.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Recollection1-1056x594.jpg 1056w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Recollection1-1320x743.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>You still do work in these institutions; have you seen any changes in the institutional landscape when it comes to art schools/the arts and diversity?</strong></p>



<p>It was quite interesting because there were points throughout my education here I could just count the black people or people of colour on my hand in spaces; I call it the Where’s Wally analogy, where you walk into a space and you start counting the black people. It almost starts as a joke but then you start doing it unconsciously and you’re like ‘oh snap, I’m doing that thing again.’ Throughout art school we were in the minority, and I remember having a conversation with someone being like ‘oh well, you know, they don’t apply’ and me thinking that’s not justification anymore&#8230;</p>



<p>Make yourselves known as an institution that is welcoming people – because that’s the problem. People don’t see themselves in those spaces, so they assume that it’s not for them, and that is the whole problem when it comes to representation. I think I’ve had one lecturer of colour that taught me throughout the whole of my university experience, then there was a black female lecturer that I didn’t have because I decided to study abroad that year. That’s literally throughout the whole of my university experience.</p>



<p>It’s not enough anymore for that to be the case. So when it comes to institutions, especially academic institutions, there’s so much work to be done in order to create representation that’s in the curriculum. There’s no reason for there not to be a black British art history curriculum, you know.</p>



<p>We can reel off so many names, and especially in contemporary art, so there’s no need. I think we’re in a stage now where as a community we’re tired of the lip service and we’re tired of the tick box notion, so we can only hope that there will be a change when it comes to, particularly for me, the curriculum… What was quite striking when I was doing my Battle of Lewisham job, when I was researching a lot for these different documentaries (whether it was about knife crime or policing), was how many people don’t know about our history when we spent countless years learning about Henry the 8<sup>th</sup>.</p>



<p>Henry the 8<sup>th</sup> isn’t going anywhere. There’s a whole, you know, Hampton Court that you can go visit. For me I did grow up knowing these stories but even then, only in a very word of mouth sort of way from my parents, maybe in passing. But the Battle of Lewisham more so because it directly affected my family. But yeah to have none of that referenced in the curriculum, even the Battle of Lewisham, is ridiculous to me.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-Battle-of-Lewisham-Still--1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4945" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-Battle-of-Lewisham-Still--1024x683.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-Battle-of-Lewisham-Still--768x512.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-Battle-of-Lewisham-Still--1536x1024.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-Battle-of-Lewisham-Still--1320x880.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>I think at this present moment I’m kind of hitting this wall of questioning who the work’s for, thinking about exactly what you’re saying, how much to give into the subject. There’s the battle of Lewisham film, and my family is very much connected to that story and because of the traumatic nature of it the documentary’s actually a very different documentary than what it could have been, and I completely stripped my family’s direct involvement. And that was for two reasons; it was in one sense to protect my family and, again, like you mentioned, the trauma, but also because it was a bigger story at the time.</p>



<p><strong>You mentioned your family &#8211; your grandparents are of the Windrush generation, and your heritage works a lot into your practice; does it ever get too difficult when you’re getting very personal with it and telling these stories that are hard for not only yourself but for your family to relive?</strong></p>



<p>I’ve had quite a good experience. I’ve spent quite a lot of time speaking to and interviewing my granddad specifically and I think it’s been quite cathartic for him as someone who’s been through a lot of trauma, had a lot of experiences. He’s watched the documentary about knife crime, he’s watched the documentary about the New Cross Fire, and it’s interesting. When we’re doing the sessions and he’s relaying these things to me it can be quite difficult, to hear about the genuine struggle it was to be a black man in 1985. But I do genuinely think it’s important for me to be documenting these things or at least having that record of those conversations.</p>



<p>It was 40 years since the battle of Lewisham so it felt more like a story about the actual happening and the people, not just our separate family story, which would require a lot more sensitivity. I think naturally the closer you are to something the harder it can be, but I think that’s why using this recurring image of the yam allows me to be able to, you know, think about the topic in more of a nuanced and abstract way. Also, using the yam’s quite humorous.</p>



<p><strong>I’m glad we’re back with yam &#8211; when and how did it evolve from this food or everyday object into the symbol you make it in your work?</strong></p>



<p>It’s a weird one because I was studying abroad, during my BA, in Vancouver. I was in western Canada so there wasn’t a language barrier, so going into that space I didn’t expect to have this big culture shock. I didn’t expect to have this big cultural identity awakening. I got there and everyone was calling me African American. And I was like… I’m just confused! I’m here with what I believe is a very think South London accent, or at least a very British accent&#8230; Calling me African American?</p>



<p>And I had a task when I got back from studying abroad, we all had to do a show, and yam drew me in. I just felt… I’m going to put yam in a bag and make a few sculptures out of them because my mum used to have this running joke when we were younger: ‘if you don’t behave yourself I’ll send you back to the Caribbean to plant yam,’ and I just always thought that was quite interesting. And since then I’ve kind of stuck with it as a medium because I’m still not necessarily finished with it. Again, at the moment, at this specific time, I might be at a slight wall with it, and I’m thinking about how I want to refine using the medium.</p>



<p>The yam is very much linked to the experience of black people and them migrating into the landscape. It’s so interesting &#8211; the sculptures are quite tall and a lot of people ask me “where did you buy that material from?” or “what is it?” It was hilarious when I was at Goldmiths because people would ask where did you get it from and I was like across the road… literally across the road.</p>

<p>When I was in Reading I started working with a girl who was from Poland and she one day said to me “I’m going to go get traditional polish food from a shop just across the road” and I was like “where?” At this point I’d lived there going on four years so I said oh okay I’ll come with you, very intrigued as to where I was going to find this shop… and it’s right in the centre of town, right between Burger King and Iceland or whatever. And I thought how have I never seen this place before?</p>



<p>When I think about that, that’s how I think maybe people see the yam. It almost just gets etched out because it’s not a cultural norm or necessity for them. So yeah, that’s kind of the story of me working with yam as a material. It’s interesting because I recently just started becoming a figure within the work. Prior it was more sculpture and other subjects that I’m interviewing. When you do performance art sometimes having to direct people, especially in an artistic way where it’s so abstract, it can be difficult. Whereas for me I knew what I was thinking in terms of style and actuality. I’m not behind the camera.</p>



<p><strong>When you insert yourself into your art how do you see yourself? What’s your relation to yourself and the art?</strong></p>



<p>That’s a good question. I guess I see myself as a subject but also kind of like an art medium, because, obviously, it’s performance so the art going on within the performance kind of becomes the artwork if you know what I mean. And a lot of the actual performances are very much to do with my own thought process at the time, they’re very much off the cuff because they’re meant to be live and in the moment.</p>



<p>I don’t want to have to sit and plan these really rigid routines or whatever. I think it’s all about the connection with the space and the audience in the specific time. It’s kind of hard to explain it. That’s a very interesting question because I’ve not thought about it in that way. I guess I found it quite liberating to be able to really, in the full sense, explore visually what I’m thinking. Using myself as a subject I’m able to do that.</p>

<p><strong>What was the pandemic like for you as an artist, from a creative perspective as well as personally and career-wise?</strong></p>



<p>I think it’s hit me in two different waves. When the pandemic first hit, I think it was actually an opportunity to be like well the only thing I do have is my art practice. Because before that I was spending a lot of time trying to develop in the television industry, an industry that’s very alien to me not coming from an Oxbridge background, which I didn’t even know was apparently the ticket into television, but it is apparently. I was always feeling like I had to beat down walls in that circle…</p>



<p>I kind of had the opportunity during the lockdown to really focus on the art that I had created previously and think about new ideas. I got lucky to have access to a window exhibition, that was for my Evolved piece, for three months. That was interesting; to be able to look at different ways of presenting work. Prior to that a lot of my work was more digital: this was now more print and sculpture, so that was really interesting.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="684" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Daughters-of-Hannah-2-684x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4938" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Daughters-of-Hannah-2-684x1024.jpg 684w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Daughters-of-Hannah-2-768x1150.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Daughters-of-Hannah-2-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Daughters-of-Hannah-2-1320x1977.jpg 1320w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Daughters-of-Hannah-2.jpg 1368w" sizes="(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px" /></figure>

<p>I guess lockdown one felt quite productive in terms of “right, I have my art practice,” etc. etc. The only problem was, as we kept on waiting and waiting for things to open back up, that’s when it started stagnating for me in terms of what I can actually do moving forward. So now I’ve been in this situation where I’m contemplating freelance work and commission work, the realistic nature of being able to form a career in that way. This had been a big dent… I think a lot of us were just starting to get into our stride especially after university.</p>



<p>Just trying to find day to day jobs has been my focus rather than trying to find/run a platform for other people as well as trying to think about what you need to do to survive.</p>



<p>And then we had Black Lives Matter in the cocoon of a pandemic where everyone was inside and the news was just…every single day, you know what I mean. And that was a big hit on me because personally I wasn’t able to go to the protests as we were shielding at the time.</p>



<p>There was this pressure as well, especially as someone who makes work like what we were talking about &#8211; black, political art &#8211; so if you’re not in the frontline suddenly there’s all this pressure around what I should be doing or what as a community we should be doing. It was all task forces and letters and all this stuff, so that also had a hold. And I felt like in a way there was an element of me that wanted to put all that energy into artwork, but it was also exhausting and very traumatic.</p>



<p>So I think we’ve been hit with almost two main things: a pandemic in its natural form which shut down everything, and also what is the growing diversity issue and crisis that we have in this country. It’s been very intense to kind of just function. This time has also allowed me to experiment in ways that I wouldn’t have had access to or had the time to do, so that feels quite exciting and now it’s about trying to refine and think about developing the ideas.</p>



<p><strong>George Floyd &#8211; whenever these big racial incidents happen we always see this push for more black art, more exposure… what was your experience after the event?</strong></p>



<p>The funniest thing was, my phone has not stopped ringing. That space of time was the most calls I’ve gotten. Obviously in March, when no one had any work and with the art industry and television industry sort of crashing, people didn’t really have any sort of work &#8211; that was still going on in May/ June time of that year &#8211; so for me when I was getting all these calls, I can only put my finger on the fact that suddenly they want to draw out the diversity.</p>



<p>Personally, I had a very big problem with black out Tuesday, I did not, I do not support it, especially because it came from within these creative industries trying to boycott and have this kind of black, but that doesn’t actually address the issues. I think what’s been happening are these very quick responses, companies pledging a million this a million that, which doesn’t actually hone in on the heart of the issues, which is the lack of representation at the top. I think a lot of people think we want some of these big wig cis-white men to be kicked off their pedestals and to have to sign on at the job centre; that’s not what we’re saying (not that that wouldn’t be a good idea… but that’s not what we’re saying).</p>



<p>We’re just saying we also want to have a seat at the table. Also, I do think it’s been such a difficult one because there’s been so many interesting ways that people have been trying to think about diversity but also they all feel quite tick boxy. I think the struggle has been that when you do have these institutions that have been white washed trying to lead diversity, they’ll never understand.</p>



<p>It’s weird because it definitely feels like “our time” but at the same time I do think that’s damaging. Because we’re going through a period of trauma and then we’re expected to make work or have these ideas and I think when it first hit there were times when I was drawing a complete blank because I was so fixated on what was the change in the story that was unfolding at the time.</p>



<p>I definitely do think a change is coming, but what I’m worried about is the systematic interplays that it’s rooted in. I do feel there’s kind of like puppeteer elements, people who are holding the privilege in a lot of these institutions and who just want to be seen to be diverse so they don’t get dragged on Instagram and Twitter. So yeah it’s interesting… it’s hilarious actually.</p>

<div class="wp-block-column">
<p><strong>Your latest piece was Daughters of Hannah; will you talk about that a bit</strong></p>



<p>Daughters of Hannah came from spirituality, and it’s kind of looking at the story of Hannah in the bible, in the Old Testament, which sees Hannah initially as barren, wanting a child. And predominantly, as traditional stories go, or biblical references and conventional stories, it’s this male figure that she’s granted with.</p>



<p>So I was interested in how initially she was tormented by that fact that she couldn’t have children, specifically because she was a second wife to someone who could, so I was just interested in those unborn initial female offspring, with a lower case <em>f</em>. I kind of wanted the yam to be this personification of those feelings and I was trying to embody the essence of Hannah in a creating a black female -again, lower case <em>f </em>&#8211; reference to that experience I guess.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>It’s filmed in several different locations, to make reference to placing black bodies in rural landscapes, and you see me walking through the landscapes with the yam. It’s very regal, there’re references to soldiers, and also in this very white pure garment which makes reference to Rastafarianism but also to priesthood… so there were a lot of different ideas in the piece. And it was actually interesting: because of time and because of just general life the work became quite different to what is was meant to be.</p>



<p>It was meant to be this kind of five-part film with me walking through all these different landscapes, and we’ve got all those pieces filmed, but due to time we exhibited for the show still photography and the sculptures, which was interesting because it allowed to me to see each section as separate. I also created this garden piece, which I’d always wanted to create.</p>



<p>I merged poetry and sound and had a lot of collaboration. It was a piece in which I was able to collaborate and really think about my personal journey. There’re references to mental health, references to my own spirituality&#8230; The piece is still developing and evolving. I’m currently in the process of trying to find to an editor to work with to edit the film. I’m thinking around a five to seven minute film, maybe a split screen composition. There’re a lot of ideas and like I said it’s still being developed so it’s an ongoing piece. But there was a lot of collaboration and a lot of montage and working with a lot of different people.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have a piece of art or a project that you’re most proud of?</strong></p>



<p>I’m pretty proud of my degree show piece. That was probably one of the first times my ideas came together because it was actually quite a struggle. It’s interesting, I spoke to my lecturer the other day; I’m still quite good friends with her because I guest lecture back at Reading. My lecturer, Christine Ellison, she was quite tough and I chose her on purpose because you can very much coast by thinking you’ve got great ideas and you get to results day and you’re like huh? She really pushed me and was very much like “there’s something missing, there’s something missing.”Tthere was always something missing, it was very intense.</p>



<p>I think because that was the first time I started experimenting with the yam specifically it was nice to see all the ideas come together. It was kind of like a two-part film where I interview both my granddad and my aunt, who’s from Birmingham. They were both talking about their journeys through Windrush, and I merged that with different experiments I was doing with the yam. It was a powerful way for me to really start thinking about the ideas I was interested in. Technically it wasn’t 100% there, but in terms of all the separate elements I think I’m still trying to work on refining those.</p>



<p>There’s a contrast between that piece, or a connection between that piece, and Daughters of Hannah, and that’s something I find quite interesting as well.</p>

<p><strong>What’s your advice for young artists?</strong></p>



<p>I spent so many years doing a lot of joint things: my degree was art and philosophy, when I was at Goldsmiths I was doing documentary film but I was really trying to keep that foot in the art world, and even now with television because there’re are many different routes you kind of start off trying to do as much of everything as you can and you get yourself at a point where you’re just like… AAAH.</p>



<p>So I think it’s important, and I’ve actually never said this, to just go towards where your passion takes you and try lead that into something you can specialise in. Just be mindful of juggling too many plates because I think they will come crashing down.</p>



<p>A friend of mine also mentioned something to me recently about saying no. As someone who doesn’t come from a space where daddy’s going to give me a job or daddy’s friend’s going to give me a job, I came from this space where you had to say yes to everything, to every opportunity. And then you get to a point where halfway through said opportunity you’re like I don’t know if this is for me but you’re not really from a privileged position where you can say no.</p>



<p>So that’s the other thing, get to a space where if someone might offer you an opportunity to do something but that’s not in your actual plan for yourself or what you want to do, you say no. And I definitely think there’s sometimes more power in saying no, especially if it’s for the sake of the direction in which you want to go.</p>

<p>My work combines weaving with mechanics to document micro social systems. Using systematised observation, I make pieces that try to highlight small human moments with an existentialist viewpoint, inspired by writers like Samuel Beckett. I am trying to do my best, processing daily observations, the only ones I feel comfortable trusting.</p>



<figure id="inlinevideo" class="wp-block-video marginbottom desktoponly"><video controls src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/yt5s.com-Things-I-Do-Sometimes_-Step-in-Gum-1080p.mp4"></video></figure>



<figure id="inlinevideo" class="wp-block-video marginbottom inlinevideo mobileonly"><video controls src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Comp-1-1.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>I do this through my recent series: “things I do sometimes”. I start with listing actions in a scientific-like approach, moving left to right in a regularly occupied space, listing every action to do with an object; scroll through phone, charge phone, lock phone, forget password. I then pick an item, and convert it into moving tapestry, often weaving it, then using motors to animate the piece.</p>



<figure id="inlinevideo" class="wp-block-video marginbottom"><video controls src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/yt5s-com-Things-I-do-Sometimes_-Hoover-up-Stuff-1080p.mp4"></video></figure>



<figure id="inlinevideo" class="wp-block-video marginbottom mobileonly"><video controls src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Comp-1_1.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>The result varies, sometimes they work consistently, other times they only work for a few seconds. This results in the art being stable; in the form of a mechanical tapestry, or un-stable; in the form of a short video and the tapestry pieces archived.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="819" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/situp-819x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4897" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/situp-819x1024.png 819w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/situp-768x960.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/situp.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px" /></figure>



<p>The purpose is to examine these daily moments and highlight their importance despite their inconsequential nature. By making the work move, the complexity of each moment is transcribed, by weaving these moments, the importance of them is retained.</p>

<p>Temporary Before Permanent is a contemporary art exhibition showcasing prints that were collected and archived over the artists’ time here in the UK. Born and raised in Taiwan, Ann Chang has a background in fine arts, special effects and fashion design. Their artwork showcased their talent brought from all of their past experiences as well as their Taiwanese cultural heritage. With a scent of melancholia, their artwork focuses on bringing joy and laughters to the stressed, anxious modern world.</p>



<p>Originally from a small town based in Taiwan, Ann takes inspiration from the origins of her parents’ home where rain and wet weather are common phenomena. Through connections from back home, as well as friendships built within East London, interactions of culture form many aspects of the artist’s work which are delicately showcased within the amalgamation of this exhibition.</p>



<p>Ann beautifully depicts her feelings of nostalgia in the form of delicate carbon prints frozen in time inside a solid resin casing. Although slightly faded, just like her memories of childhood, the sentiment of her rainy hometown is never completely forgotten as those memories are etched into every new drawing of a vase for someone else to keep forever. The delicate carbon prints are contrasted with a solid resin casing which symbolises her desire to preserve her most guarded treasure; her sense of self and belonging. The viewer is invited to open their mind and draw their own conclusions based on this juxtaposition of strongly dissimilar elements.</p>



<p>The first thing you notice in Ann’s drawing is the abundant use of natural elements such as flowers and storms. As you are drawn more into the detail of the designs, the vases begin to tell you a story. For example, on one vase, a young man can be seen crying a tear drop in the shape of a star while his head is stuck in a raging storm, above his head grows a single rose reaching for the sky. You can then export your vision to a fanciful world where the image comes to life as the young man overcomes his sadness, shatters the vase that imprisoned him and blossoms into the person he was born to be.</p>



<p>The artist has an obsession with vases which took her a long time to figure out what it meant to her. She explained “Vases are like people, they are in all shapes and colors and it’s up to you what you’d like to put inside of it. The vases I draw are often covered in rain texture which represents the melancholic rainy cities and small towns I live and lived in. ”</p>



<p>As well as representing a collection of experiences found through human connection, Ann’s visual arts creations aim to present a discovery of peace within all aspects of art-making. Seen as a form of therapeutic experience, there is power in the artwork not only for the artist, but also the people who connect and participate with it, as well as the clients who get to keep it forever.</p>



<p>Framed as a non-aggressive approach to active creation, these prints represent the idea of continuously being able to find joy in a time of challenges and hardships.</p>
