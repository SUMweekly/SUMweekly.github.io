<p>Every Monday evening a community of musicians get together to share the spirit and love of music. I visited for the first time last month and was completely in awe of the sheer collaboration and seamlessness of it all.</p>



<figure id="inlinevideo" class="wp-block-video marginbottom"><video controls src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/258761103_612860063395446_2175857866897775168_n.mp4"></video></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/richybomaye/">@richybomaye</a> was the jam host on the evening, he joined the band in August when he came to the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/colourfactorylondon/">@colourfactorylondon</a> alongside a friend. When it used to be a smaller session, just on a balcony.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/247932441_2998737410341407_1936724718088361079_n-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5167" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/247932441_2998737410341407_1936724718088361079_n-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/247932441_2998737410341407_1936724718088361079_n-768x768.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/247932441_2998737410341407_1936724718088361079_n-200x200.jpg 200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/247932441_2998737410341407_1936724718088361079_n.jpg 1066w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>He performed that same day, ‘it was the first time I really got to understand and appreciate live music… Seeing musicians and rappers come together and make something so raw and soulful’.</p>

<p>The word ‘Ori&#8217;, meaning ‘soul’ in Yoruba , refers not so much to the genre of soul, but instead the essence of putting ones soul into the music.</p>

<p>Orii Jam allows people to break down the boundaries that hold fear around self-expression and performance, and collide musically. The energy on stage and in the crowd is hugely friendly.. supported by the host&#8217;s natural energy and drive.</p>

<p>From popping up at jazz jams with his trombone to keeping the rhythm section tight with his bass guitar, multi-instrumentalist Jacob seems to be everywhere at the moment. In between showcasing his impressive array of beats and giving his best blue-steel impression, he gave us an insight into life as a musician…</p>



<p><strong>Introduce yourself, who are you and what do you do?</strong></p>



<p>My name is Jacob May. I am an 18 year old vocalist, multi-instrumentalist and producer.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns collapse-above-right">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p><strong>What are your aspirations as a musician and how are you going to get there?</strong></p>



<p>Eventually I want to sell my own music in my own name, or as a group amongst friends if I’m lucky enough. The perfect example would be Ezra Collective.</p>



<p>You see people like <em>Joe Armon-Jones</em> in the group who is also killing it with his own personal projects, not to mention <em>Femi Koleoso</em>, who was previously <em>Jorja Smith</em>’s drummer and is now part of<em> Gorillaz</em></p>



<p><strong>What was the last song you listened to that made you feel something?</strong></p>



<p>I can’t lie man, while having a proper dig back into some old <em>Alfa Mist</em>, there was something about<em> ‘Falling’ </em>featuring <em>Kaya Thomas-Dyke</em> on vocals, off his album ‘Structuralism’, that made me so emotionally attached to so many different things. </p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="683" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jacob-6resized-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4813" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jacob-6resized-683x1024.jpg 683w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jacob-6resized-768x1152.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jacob-6resized-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jacob-6resized-1320x1980.jpg 1320w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jacob-6resized.jpg 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></figure>
</div>
</div>



<p>Whether that be the songwriting, the instrumentation or how the music was sonically. Whenever I listen to ‘Falling’ I get goosebumps every time, leaving me inspired to look more into sound design and have more of a range of instruments in my music.</p>



<p><strong>Give me a your ideal band, you&#8217;re playing bass, who are the others?</strong></p>



<p>I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately after numerous conversations with people who are keen to get writing and making some music. I’d look at my lineup in two ways. The way I’m looking to write music is both with my vocals and also instrumental. </p>



<div class="wp-block-columns collapse-above-left">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="683" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jacob-10resized-1-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4819" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jacob-10resized-1-683x1024.jpg 683w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jacob-10resized-1-768x1152.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jacob-10resized-1-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jacob-10resized-1-1320x1980.jpg 1320w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jacob-10resized-1.jpg 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></figure>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>This is heavily inspired by a saxophonist and producer named <em>Venna</em>. He has a project out which is part instrumental and part vocal. So, in an instrumental situation, I’d be on bass, my friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/luciamusicc/">Lucia</a>, would be on keys, vocals and trumpet. I’d have my bro <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lox_drumz/">Ebz</a> on drums and then the one and only <a href="https://www.instagram.com/benglassermusic/">Ben Glasser</a> on electric guitar.</p>



<p>In a situation where I’d be on vocals, I’m absolutely spoiled for choice for a bassist. I could have <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kavitron.exe/">Kavi</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kobeheathngugi/">Kobe </a>or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/patchsawyer/">Patch</a> on bass, in a situation where they could all take part or have gigs at a time because they’re all killing bassists and amazing people.</p>



<p>This also made me think about how when I’m not singing, I could also hop on trombone, for a melody or when soloing. I feel like this group could really hold it down well. It gets me excited just speaking about it, let alone actually playing with them.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p><strong>Do you feel nervous before a gig? How do you cope?</strong></p>



<p>My honest answer is, no, not really. Since I’ve started doing gigs, I’ve kept this mentality of ‘treat it just like practice’ and I almost picture as if not a single person is there watching me, so I have nothing to worry about. While having good energy on stage is key, I‘ve really been working on holding it down and keeping things simple.</p>



<p><strong>How do you feel about the future?</strong></p>



<p>I’m quite excited about what the future holds. Every now and then it’s very easy to get ahead of myself and have flashes of seeing my name in shining lights, going on tour, the things you dream of as a musician. But, obviously, these things don’t come without grit, determination and hard work. So, right now I’m just trying my best to stay grounded, continuing to work hard, taking the right paths and guidance from people, with the hopes of achieving big and that good things come my way eventually.</p>

<p>Eliza Oakes is a vocalist, musician and arranger who was born and raised in SE London. After spending years perfecting her skills as a live performer, Eliza has now set out as a recording artist. Coming from her new genre-jumping EP&nbsp; ‘<strong>An Intuition’ </strong>Eliza has just released the stunning visuals for the single ‘<strong>Til They’re Gone</strong>’.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns collapse-above-right">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p><strong>Through hearing clips on instagram a couple years ago I first thought you were very much a jazz vocalist. Your recent music is quite a deviation from these jazz roots, how did that change happen?</strong></p>



<p>So I studied jazz at Guildhall for 4 years, but I never went with the aim to come out at the other end a strictly jazz musician. Don’t get me wrong I love it, but the main aim was to learn how to improvise as a vocalist.</p>



<p>&nbsp;I grew up in a church environment and had always sung with choirs, after completing classical singing grades in school, it got to the point in sixth form where I had to choose musically where to go next.&nbsp; Improvisation is now a solid way in which I express musically!&nbsp;</p>



<p>The motivation behind it was The music industry is designed to box you in a specific genre is seems, I try and stay away from all that and just express what feels right.&nbsp; The first single off the EP ‘Let It Be Known’ definitely feels like a pop record I’d say, but you can hear some of alternative influences creeping in for sure!</p>



<p></p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="679" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0197resized-679x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4749" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0197resized-679x1024.jpg 679w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0197resized-768x1159.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0197resized-1018x1536.jpg 1018w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0197resized-1357x2048.jpg 1357w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0197resized-1320x1992.jpg 1320w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0197resized-scaled.jpg 1696w" sizes="(max-width: 679px) 100vw, 679px" /></figure>
</div>
</div>



<p><strong>There’s even quite a big genre-jump between that single and your new release <em>Til They&#8217;re Gone&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>Definitely, and I had a few worries when writing the EP whether it would feel like a cohesive project, each song on the EP feels like it’s in a separate room!&nbsp; But I’m influenced by many different styles and genres so it feels right!&nbsp; It’s a brief introduction into the ways in which I communicate vocally and musically, so was important to give the listeners a range to sit with.</p>

<p><strong>You’re very much a trained musician, and obviously have skills beyond just your voice, what was creating the EP like?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Well funnily enough it was all kind of done from my bedroom. I knew I Creating this EP was such a new experience for me because I was used to predominately performing music live rather than recording it which takes a different kind of skill.</p>



<p> Faced with the lockdown, I ended up having to record a lot of the parts remotely with the help of my band and wonderful string section that you hear!  It of course wasn’t the same as all being in the same room, but it encapsulates the time and space in which it was born.  </p>



<p>Written, arranged and produced by myself, two of the tracks were also co-produced by long time collaborator and close friend Lorenz Okello.  It’s so important to work with people that you trust and he was the biggest blessing when it came to recording!</p>
</div>
</div>



<p><strong>As you’ve said, gigs and live performances are your forte, do you think that was born from the church?</strong></p>



<p>Because it was my first musical environment, I’d say partly so yes!&nbsp; Even though my relationship with church has changed, I’m heavily inspired and still listen to a lot of gospel music, particularly as a vocalist.&nbsp; I’m also part of a gospel/soul choir called The Mike King Collective- it’s being surrounded by multiple harmonising voices which has had the biggest impact on my voice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also grew up on a lot of musical theatre and so performing live has just always felt really natural to me- even though it can still be nerve-wracking!  When singing live, I never sing a song the same again, it’s so freeing, and something that’s not quite able to be replicated when recording.</p>



<p><strong>Lets talk about the video&#8230;what was the experience like when filming it, and how did you manage to find such an amazing location?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The process of planning, writing and filming a music video I’d never experienced anything like that before, it was immensely overwhelming and stressful leading up to it, especially as an independent artist with no management or label helping me.&nbsp; Balancing the logistics along with my actual performance was indeed a lot to handle but on the day it went pretty smoothly!</p>



<p>The church that it was filmed in is called All Saints Church in New Cross, where I grew up, the wonderful Vicar Grant I’ve gotten to know over the last year, he’s also a great musician and let me use the space to practice and rehearse.&nbsp; He kindly let us use the space for the whole day to capture the shoot!&nbsp; An amazing opportunity indeed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0011resized-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4741" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0011resized-1024x683.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0011resized-768x512.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0011resized-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_0011resized-1320x880.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>&nbsp;I asked Elsa Hackett, (also known as ELSAS) to co-direct the video with me.&nbsp; Not only is she a really close friend of mine but one of my favourite artists and musicians who directed her own music video last year!&nbsp; It was a perfect collaboration, and refreshing to have someone interpret the song alongside me.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>The video follows a lead up to a final performance, along the way we’re introducing different visuals, specifically close up shots of hands, and the way they can be held.&nbsp; The concept of the song itself is a personal one but we wanted to capture the feeling of unconditional love, and the fears alongside it in a universal context.&nbsp; There are so many ways two people can hold hands, not to mention the emotions that can also be captured within the gesture whether it be anger, loneliness or love.&nbsp; </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="715" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-2021-11-04-at-10.49.44-copyresized-1024x715.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4752" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-2021-11-04-at-10.49.44-copyresized-1024x715.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-2021-11-04-at-10.49.44-copyresized-768x536.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-2021-11-04-at-10.49.44-copyresized-1536x1072.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-2021-11-04-at-10.49.44-copyresized-1320x921.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It was amazing to work with choreographer Tali Foxworthy-Bowers to portray the songs narrative in the movement of the video, with the ensemble section in the dream-like, spinning state as well as the hand motions.&nbsp; It is all piecing together my imagination to bring forth the simplicity of the final shot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The wonderful cast was made up of a mixture of people i’d grown up with/old friends/new friends and people i’d met on the day, and it really added to the feelings of love that I’m exploring in the song.&nbsp; I wanna give another huge shout out to every person who contributed to this video, wouldn’t have been possible with your support and efforts. &nbsp;</p>

<p>We headed down to the Thaddaeus Ropac gallery in Bond street to check out <a href="https://ropac.net/online-exhibitions/51-ron-mueck-25-years-of-sculpture-19962021/">Ron Mueck’s ’25 years of Sculpture’.</a></p>



<p>The exhibition debuts some of Muecks’ first work as an artist. After years of producing elaborate puppets and models for television and film he moved on to sculpture when he turned 40, first gaining renown for his work ‘Dead Dad’, a portrayal of his recently deceased father.</p>



<p>Ron uses hyperrealism while he toys with scale in his extraordinary sculptures. He ventures through the ages, from birth to death expressing dramatic detail in his sculptures visually, whilst highlighting significant moments of his own life.</p>



<p>The impact and intensity of his craft is evident in the work, with some pieces taking more than a year to create&#8230;</p>

<p>Starting off in the depths of Fallowfield, Manchester, The Grove are like your typical student band apart from the fact they sound…..great? We sat down with them after a photoshoot for a brief (very brief) and insightful (only thing I learned is that they take themselves very seriously) interview&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>We are The Grove, a genre-fluid collective who just rock out and have a good time….. get bare bread (hopefully). But yeah we obviously take ourselves quite seriously, don’t you forget that.</em></p>

<p><strong>How did The Grove Start?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>So we originally started in Manchester Uni; Sheffield, Joe F, Joel, Robert. Just jamming, having a good time… VIBESEY.</p>



<p>Then our best buddy Pete who we’ve known for time came through and joined the ranks. We’ve collected a load of other rugrats and stragglers along the way.</p>

<p><strong>Goals and Aspirations?</strong></p>



<p>We want to be the biggest band in the world, play at Wembley, then Hoots,<strong> </strong>then Amersham and I think we’ll be good. We’re also planning on bringing Baroque back in the mainstream. Really and truly though we’re just trying to rehearse without having two thirds of the band going on holiday</p>

<p>Fresh from releasing the Jazz-influenced musical odyssey ‘Divine Ascension’, Muva of Earth<strong> </strong>creates soulful, hypnotic music that resonates with the depths of your mind. Always focused on growing her community, Muva is also known for creating <a href="https://www.instagram.com/babylonchantdown/">Babylon Chant Down</a>, a safe space for the diaspora which captured the energy and emotions of last summer, whilst also promoting often-ignored creative voices…</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p><strong>How did you get into music?</strong></p>



<p>I’ve always loved music from an early age, I was always dancing, singing, flowing on stage, just manifesting it you know? My mum enjoys gospel music but my family doesn’t really have a passion for it, so I’ve always had to fight and push myself to get into it.</p>



<p>The first step was singing lessons, they really helped me gain control of my voice, learn techniques and ways to maintain it. I then started going to music school, I grew up in London but then moved to Kent when my mum remarried, which was obviously a mad change.</p>



<p>There was a lot of space out there, I was grateful for the open areas and opportunity to experience different things. I think travelling from Kent to East London for music helped me grow as a person, I could just flow from two very different situations.</p>
</div>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="683" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Davina-Final-Edits-4-2-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4525" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Davina-Final-Edits-4-2-683x1024.jpg 683w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Davina-Final-Edits-4-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Davina-Final-Edits-4-2.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></figure>
</div>
</div>



<p><strong>Where does your name come from?</strong></p>



<p>The name ‘muva of Earth’ comes from my nickname ‘Mother’ in college, I was known for having colourful clothing and it just stuck. I’m definitely a spiritual person and am trying to grow my practice every day, to really grow and develop you have to incorporate spirituality into your every day. I feel like my music reflects that, it mirrors what’s going on in my heart and my emotions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="721" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Davina-Final-Edits-4-3-1024x721.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4526" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Davina-Final-Edits-4-3-1024x721.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Davina-Final-Edits-4-3-768x541.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Davina-Final-Edits-4-3.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>How do you make music?</strong></p>



<p>I have to be in the right mindset to make a song. Obviously you can make music from a place of pain, but I have blockages if I’m not feeling comfortable and calm. Before I made ‘Divine Ascension’ I was homeless for some time, I was struggling to get into the studio and had to move back to Kent. When I finally found my sanctuary I made Divine Ascension, <em>‘My soul will always flow, beyond this dimension’, </em>it’s about being resilient and manifesting good things to come.</p>

<div class="wp-block-column">
<p><strong>Tell us about your experiences last year and how that resulted in Babylon Chant Down?</strong></p>



<p>Last year was really traumatic for the whole African Diaspora. Racism has always been presented to us in images in black and white, as if it was long time ago. British institutions try and convince us that we’re better now, that racism is a relic from a bygone era&#8230; I remember just lying in my bed and just deeping that there are actually people out there who will hate me because of the colour of my skin.</p>



<p>I went to the protests with the hope of being with the collective and having my voice heard, but to be honest I didn’t feel that comfortable. Protests obviously have importance but it wasn’t the right method for me, I felt that people weren’t listening to each other, and that all this emotion was going to waste.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>Obviously I’m a musician so me and a friend had the idea to have a music-facing gathering, create a safer space where people could speak and really be heard, and that’s how <a href="https://www.instagram.com/babylonchantdown/">Babylon Chant Down</a> came about. There’s many different forms of protest and different methods, we were just trying to find our own.</p>

<p>Hailing from SE London, Lakuna are a collective of musicians drawing inspirations from soul, jazz and hip-hop, all the while crafting their own unique sound. SUM sat down with lead singer Esme, lead guitarist Ben and Producer/Manger Stan (who also heads the futuristic SouthSpace Label) to hear about their new EP ‘Where We Go’.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns collapse-above-right">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p><strong>How did you guys link-up with Stan?</strong></p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ben:</span> He first heard our old EP Evening Gold and did a remix of one of our tunes.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Esme:</span> &nbsp;Yeah he’s always supported us from the start really.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ben:</span> When no-one else did!!</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stan:</span> I approached Ben first about doing some things in the studio, then reached back out with the idea of taking up more of a managerial role. I’ve been in the music industry for a little bit, I wanted to use whatever links I had to push Lakuna.</p>



<p>We got in the studio but then obviously Covid hit, it was a bit of a weird one, it was a long time of writing and some of the early tunes ended up getting cut. I don’t think that’s necessarily a bad thing tho, it’s good to experiment.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large collapseaboveright"><img loading="lazy" width="683" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lakunasum3-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4433" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lakunasum3-683x1024.jpg 683w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lakunasum3-768x1152.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lakunasum3-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lakunasum3-1320x1980.jpg 1320w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lakunasum3.jpg 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></figure>
</div>
</div>



<p><strong>And what’s the process, how do your songs get written?</strong></p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Esme:</span> &nbsp;It changes from tune to tune, but I’d say usually Ben comes up with some chords, I’ll send over some vocals and then we’ll get into the studio for Stan to do his thangggg.&nbsp; Sometimes it comes from a Jam or a beat, something a bit more organic. But during lockdown times it was a bit harder.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stan:</span> Yeah it was great when we could get back to doing things in person. You can still get stuff done remotely but it’s&nbsp; a LOT slower and feels way less natural.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lakunasum2-1024x683.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4424" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lakunasum2-1024x683.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lakunasum2-768x512.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lakunasum2-1536x1025.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lakunasum2-1320x881.png 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Did you find any positives out of Lockdown? Obviously you’re locked-in for days on end with nothing else to do but make tunes</strong></p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ben:</span> Obviously to be deprived of actual connection, seeing your friends, it can take it’s toll on how you’re feeling.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Esme:</span><strong> </strong>I definitely think some of my lyrics are lockdown-inspired, channelling those feelings into the music.</p>



<p><strong>When I listen to the EP I wouldn’t say it was exactly a happy, good-vibes record. It seems more dark, atmospheric, do you think that reflected the mood you were in at the time?</strong></p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stan:</span> I think it’s also about escapism, a lot of the tunes are quite dreamy. It might not be necessarily a positive tune but it&#8217;s trying to help you escape reality.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Esme:</span> It’s been a year and a half since the we started making it, so I think it encapsulates quite a rollercoaster of emotions.</p>



<figure id="inlinevideo" class="wp-block-video marginbottom"><video controls src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lakunasumhq.mp4"></video></figure>



<p><strong>What’s your favorite track from the EP ? Is it something you can all agree on?</strong></p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Esme:</span> For me it’s probably first in line, although Golden Intentions is like our baby, it’s come so far. We started working on it between lockdowns, but before the bleak winter one when shit got dark. We decided to make a video because its just vibes.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stan:</span> It was one of the early tracks on the EP, and getting Poppy Daniels to come and do her thing on that track. She’s super busy so it was great to have her.</p>



<p><strong>So how was making the video for it ?</strong></p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Esme:</span> It was amazing, we had Eleanor Graham as our Creative Director, she’s got a very clear vision and was so easy to work with, so it all went very smoothly. One of my Uni mates came and danced for us. It was very hit-and-miss with the weather, but luckily Eleanor manifested us some sunshine!</p>



<p><strong>And now the EP and video are out, what’s next for Lakuna?</strong></p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ben:</span> I’m just in the mindset where I want to make more music. I think I’ve felt the least inhibited in the last year to make music and release it, so I just want to make more of that.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Esme:</span> I think we want to try experiment more, try different vibes and sounds… switch things up. We’ve got a sound which has evolved from the last EP, but there’s always room to grow and develop.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns collapse-above-right">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p><strong>Is there anyone you would love to collaborate with?</strong></p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ben:</span> I’d love to start working with different artists and producers, try to reach out to people outside of our genre</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stan:</span> There’s a Dub producer Scientist who’d id love to work with, maybe remix one of our tunes, but who knows.. I think as we progress cool collars will just naturally come out of the wood work.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ben:</span> Definitely, we’ve already worked with so many amazing artists. Theres been the king-of-sax Solaariss, Louis Keating who played some amazing keys on a couple of our tunes, Max Fraser who’s featured on two of the tunes and will be back working with us soon and then obviously the amazing Poppy Daniels.</p>

<p>We sat down with Tuka, a young London-born singer fresh off the release of her new EP ‘Folding’. Born to Iraqi parents with a musical background, Tuka spoke about struggling to find similar faces in the music industry and starting out as a singer whilst navigating a pandemic…</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns collapse-above-right">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>My mum used to be a singer. Not a western pop but the Muslim equivalent of gospel music, she wanted me to go down that path but I was more into Rhianna….Shakira….this was at like six years-old. So yeah I’d just watch them and be like that’s what I wanted to do. I wanted to be on stage and sing and make people smile and jump around, the desire to be a singer came from when I was young.</p>



<p>I come from a family with very strong Muslim beliefs so they’re not toooo keen on the route I’m on, even when I’m studying it. I used to study art at college and to them I needed to be someone else, ‘You need to do Architecture at least? Be a lawyer, a pharmacist, a doctor?’. They’d always try and incorporate art into a more ‘professional’ setting… I guess they had higher standards. But they’re letting me do my thing and I’m enjoying it. When I was younger I’d dream about it etcetera etcetera, and eventually that died out after I decided that it wasn’t realistic enough.</p>
</div>

</div>



<p>I’d watch these shows like X-Factor and I couldn’t find anyone like me, anyone I could relate to, my second names Mohammed and I felt I could never be up there. I’d keep singing but anything I’d write would just get thrown away.</p>

<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>It wasn’t until October 2018, when <a href="https://www.instagram.com/benspencebenspence/">Ben Spence</a><strong> </strong>from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fuzzbrainmusic/">Fuzzbrain</a><strong> </strong>just dropped me a message after I’d posted some stories of me singing and we just started recording together. I guess I started relatively recently but I feel like it’s always been part of me, in one shape or another, and now I’ve reverted back to 6 year-old Tuka!</p>



<p>The Ep happened very organically, experimenting with different sounds and just getting comfortable together and finding our style. Eventually Ben started talking about releasing and we chose three songs that we the happiest with, the proudest of… three babies which got mixed and mastered! But we started thinking about it in 2019 and then obviously covid happened and all of a sudden the studio was closed, we couldn&#8217;t even finish the songs. Summer came around so we could get back in there and recorded Lost Sight.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>My friend Seb<strong> </strong>who spits came down and did a mad job! Literally in the first take did it perfectly 3 times to layer it and was done, bish bash bosh….but fate wasn’t finished with us yet and a few days later <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fuzzbrainmusic/">Fuzzbrain Studios</a><strong> </strong>burnt down! It was an amazing studio which Ben had built from the ground up with his dad, they’d converted part of this warehouse into a fully functioning studio full of instruments and collections and tech which just disappeared.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>After the studio relocated to Ben’s parent’s house in Surrey we started to take trips down which was lovely, almost like a retreat.His parents were so accommodating, shouts out Bens Fam! So after a global pandemic, a few lockdowns and a fire we’ve done it! I’m proud of the whole gang and so grateful for everyone involved.</p>



<p>I’m excited to start some new stuff, I want to explore a more middle-eastern sound and work with musicians from that region. In terms of performing I’ve got a couple gigs coming up; Hoodstock on the 8th August, then obviously a session at your HQ !! Hoodstock is going to be great, a local festival full of good vibes. I think I wanna do as many gigs as I can, covids been a big obstacle be I’m hopeful for the future… the best is yet to come.</p>

<p>Yoo this is Solariss, on Friday the 23rd I put on the Yellow Hearts Jam, IN my back-garden, IN my ends… I wanted to get my friends, my guys, my community to come down and have a jam. Obviously the wind was against us but it was a big vibe, we had people coming down that I hadn’t seen in a while, we had my mum selling Jollof and everything. Some people were finally jumping on stage after like a year and a half because of covid.. It was just good vibes, big family. Loved it!</p>

<p>House talent Tycho Wadsworth AKA Foot-Loose releases the title track single for his latest EP &#8220;Orange Blue&#8221;. Released under the label on the label <a href="https://www.instagram.com/midtownhousenyc/">Midtown House</a>, the track emanates a cool warmth, expressing the atmosphere of a summer night bike ride. Its sounds set the stage for an EP loaded with soulful chords, funky bass-lines and slapping drums, set to be released on August 27th.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tycho:</span></p>



<p>The EP “Orange Blue” came about when Pedro Cañas, the boss of Midtown House got in contact with me. I had been working on some deeper sounding projects so sent over some things I’d been making and we decided to do an EP. Like I said I wanted to experiment and make some Deeper sounding tracks that are probably a bit more club focused and I’m really pleased with how they’ve turned out.</p>



<p>I made them around December &#8211; March time and it sounds weird but the main direction I was going for was like making stuff that I’d like to listen to cycling home late at night in the summer. I think I stayed true to that and the last track’s title , “Freewheeling”, is a direct nod to that, similarly with “Those Evenings”.&nbsp;</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tycho-BW-2-2-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3629" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tycho-BW-2-2-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tycho-BW-2-2-768x768.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tycho-BW-2-2-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tycho-BW-2-2-200x200.jpg 200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tycho-BW-2-2-1320x1320.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>
</div>

<p>The EP also contains hardly any live playing. The improvised parts in “Tuff Love” are live but other than that almost all the elements are programmed in, and even then all the sounds used are 100% digital, there’s no live instruments used.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve also worked with an artist, Bonnie Spencer (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/bonniespenccer/">@bonniespenccer</a>), who has created a really cool animation for the main single “Orange Blue”. It’s been really nice seeing some else interpret the music and she’s done a fantastic job, I think the sounds translate into the visuals with great effect. It’s been refreshing doing something a bit more collaborative too.</p>
